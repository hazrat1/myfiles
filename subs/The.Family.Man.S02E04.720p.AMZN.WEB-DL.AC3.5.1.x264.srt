1
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,950
Raji, it's time for you
to meet someone. Come.

2
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,290
Chief!

3
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,830
I'd told you about Raji.

4
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,790
She's the best fighter pilot we have.

5
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,080
And she finished her
training in just six months.

6
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,660
Raji… I've heard a lot about you.

7
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,750
A sparrow became a hawk!

8
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,330
That too, within six months.

9
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,700
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

10
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,620
Do you have any new
justifications to offer?

11
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,410
Is there any new evidence you
want to manufacture against Kareem?

12
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,790
Or are you here to file a new sedition
case against Kareem's family or me?

13
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,120
Did they file a case?

14
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,660
I know my apology won't bring Kareem back…

15
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,580
but still.

16
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,370
I am…

17
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,950
I am sorry.

18
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,250
Easy for you to say that, sir.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,330
You have blood on your hands,

20
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,290
but you still want a clean conscience.

21
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,290
I came here only to tell you the truth.

22
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,950
Kareem was not a terrorist.

23
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,620
He didn't deserve to die.

24
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,450
His death…

25
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,120
is on my conscience.

26
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,250
Take care.

27
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,580
I know you've recorded this conversation.

28
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,910
Use it however you want to.

29
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,080
I am willing to bear the consequences.

30
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
And as for the sedition
charges filed against you--

31
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,620
You don't need to do anything for me!

32
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,790
This is my country, too.

33
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,660
And I will fight the case with the system.

34
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,660
Okay.

35
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,870
And sir…

36
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,450
I will never forgive you.

37
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,290
Shankar, where's Nanda?

38
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,620
He hasn't come in today.

39
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,620
How well do you know Meyyappan?

40
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,250
He's my close friend and supporter.

41
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,160
He doesn't know about our plan.
It's just a sales deal for him.

42
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,160
Great.

43
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,200
Welcome, welcome!
I've been waiting for you!

44
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,620
I heard about Subbu, Chief.

45
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Sorry for your loss.

46
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,750
Meet my friend, Mr. Arjun Singh.

47
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,200
-Hello.
-Good to meet you.

48
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,450
Let us sit.

49
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,160
Both my sons live in London.

50
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,160
They don't wish to run
the flying school in Chennai.

51
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,250
That is why I am selling it off.

52
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,000
Thanks for accepting my
offer, Mr. Meyyappan.

53
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,290
It's okay.

54
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,700
How old is your brother, Mr. Arjun Singh?

55
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Vikrant is 26, Mr. Meyyappan.

56
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,910
It was heartbreaking when he was
refused admission on a physical condition.

57
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,080
That's why
I am buying him this flying school.

58
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,580
-So that he doesn't give up on his dreams.
-That is why…

59
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,950
God gave him a brother like you!

60
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,660
If you want,
we can sign the papers right away.

61
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,330
Now, you will only hear my words!

62
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,200
You will do everything as I say.

63
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,870
You will take me with you…

64
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,750
on a three-week holiday!

65
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,410
Shut up!

66
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,250
There will be no holiday!

67
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,790
Go to school and study!

68
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,160
Dad, you can't get
up in the middle of this!

69
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,450
I was taking you into
a deep state of relaxation!

70
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,120
I am done with the deep state, okay?

71
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,160
Now, I am in an alert state.

72
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,660
Or else, I'll miss my flight!

73
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,540
You should know that parents
should encourage children,

74
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,000
and their natural talents!

75
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,950
Okay, my little boy!

76
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,450
You did really well! Good job!

77
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,580
I have all my hopes pinned on you!

78
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,000
You'll make me proud!

79
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,200
We'll continue when I am back, okay?

80
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,250
Bye!

81
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,290
Now, let me pack.

82
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,580
You know, Parth lives with his mother.

83
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,910
And Rakhi lives with her father.

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,120
Whom would you want to live with?
Mom or Dad?

85
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,910
Well, it doesn't make any
difference to you, does it?

86
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,450
You have a boyfriend!

87
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,160
I am not going too far away.

88
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,620
We'll talk every day, all right?

89
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,250
Hey!

90
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,750
Tell me what's going on, Dad!

91
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,580
You guys are avoiding each other!

92
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,450
And not even talking to each other!

93
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,580
We are not idiots!

94
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,830
And I am not a kid anymore, okay?

95
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,120
That's enough, Dhriti.

96
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,540
You guys fight or not?

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,660
So, once in a while, we can also fight.

98
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,750
This is not once in a while.

99
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
You guys are going to patch
up before going or no?

100
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,660
Where the hell is my jacket?

101
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,120
Fuck!

102
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,620
Where is my jacket?

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,830
Hey!

104
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,750
Come on!

105
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,410
We'll talk on the phone.

106
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,870
Okay?

107
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,830
Okay?

108
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,290
You both are so selfish!

109
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,410
Don't ever bother calling me!

110
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,080
Come, Dad.

111
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,950
I'll walk you out.

112
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,120
I understand the seriousness, sir.

113
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,910
We are investigating, sir.

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,250
God knows what you're doing!

115
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,910
My brother-in-law has
not come home in two days!

116
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,700
-You know who I am, right?
-I know, sir.

117
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,700
What, ma'am?

118
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,120
Do something fast or else, I'll
be forced to talk to your higher-ups.

119
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,500
-I am doing my job, sir. Anything else?
-All right, okay!

120
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,410
-Give me that file.
-What is going on!

121
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,580
-Mr. Kothari, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

122
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,540
How many people work here?
How many women? Men?

123
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,790
I want all the details.

124
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,080
-Okay? I want to meet all of them.
-Sure, ma'am.

125
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,500
Have there been any
complaints against Nanda?

126
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,580
Nothing at all.

127
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,080
From the workers? Especially women?

128
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,790
No, nothing like that.

129
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,250
Is the AC not working?

130
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,700
Welcome to the hot and happening Chennai.

131
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,250
Looks like for a few days,
we'll have to make friends with this heat.

132
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,290
Summer has not even started yet.

133
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,750
Finally,
happy to have you in Chennai, sir.

134
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,080
Nice to meet you, Muthu.

135
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,950
Milind!

136
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,870
Sir?

137
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,660
Great to have you back, man.

138
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,950
Thank you, sir.

139
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,120
Welcome back to you, too!

140
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,370
So, how are you doing, Tiwari?

141
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,410
All good? Missing your corporate job?

142
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,750
I was missing you!

143
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,750
How about a kiss?

144
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,120
Fucker!

145
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,580
How are Suchi and the kids?

146
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,500
Muthu, is there any eatery close by?

147
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,290
I know the right place, I'll take you.

148
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,830
Oh, great! I love South-Indian food!

149
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,120
Which South-Indian food?

150
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,700
There are five states in South India.

151
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,200
Idli.

152
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Sambar.

153
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,750
Menduvada.

154
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,750
Meduvada!

155
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,700
Meduvada!

156
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,000
-Chutney.
-Chutney.

157
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,700
Who's calling?

158
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,700
Spam.

159
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,790
Name?

160
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,290
My name is Rajalekshmi Sekharan.

161
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,700
-Age?
-32.

162
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,500
How long have you been working here?

163
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,290
A year!

164
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,370
And where were you working before that?

165
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,290
Before this…

166
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,540
I was in my hometown.

167
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,410
My mother was ill,
so I was home for two years.

168
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,370
How is she now?

169
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,500
She passed away.

170
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,700
When was the last time you saw Mr. Nanda?

171
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,580
Tuesday, before I punched out.
He was at his desk.

172
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,790
How is he? Is he a nice guy?

173
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,160
He is a good man, ma'am.

174
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,830
How does he behave with you all?

175
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,370
I had no issues with him.

176
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,790
We only spoke about work.

177
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,250
Did you notice anything
unusual on Tuesday?

178
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,660
Did you see him fight with anyone?
On the phone or in person?

179
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,540
No idea, ma'am.

180
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,120
Write your name and
number in this book, okay?

181
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,950
Next!

182
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,330
Go!

183
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,160
Hello, ma'am.

184
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,750
-Arvind?
-He's there.

185
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,620
Hi, Suchi!

186
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,330
-Hi.
-Welcome back to ShrinkMe.

187
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,660
Glad to see you.

188
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,160
-Beautiful office!
-Thanks.

189
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,410
-Where's Nikhil?
-There he is!

190
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
-He's going through some
-Oh, hi!

191
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,290
-beta test results of our new plugins.
-Two minutes!

192
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,500
Come, I'll show you around. Come.

193
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,450
So, Nikhil wanted an open office.

194
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,040
The work is demanding, so he wanted the
atmosphere at work to be light and casual.

195
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,620
And while working over here,
we won't miss our cafes!

196
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,040
Yeah! It does look like a cafe.

197
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,790
Perceptual constancy.

198
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,790
I mean, you gravitate subconsciously
to where you started from.

199
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,450
I've never heard that before.

200
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,910
We've hit one million users. Not bad.

201
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,540
Oh, yes! We have! Come!

202
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,790
This is my workstation, and…

203
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,790
this is for you.

204
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,410
-Thank you.
-And this will be your throne!

205
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,660
Sit!

206
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,200
All the best!

207
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,290
Preparations are underway for
the upcoming bilateral talks…

208
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,370
between the Indian Prime Minister Basu

209
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,660
and the Sri Lankan President,
Lasit Rupatunga.

210
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,500
So, we've set up a temporary
base in this old guest house.

211
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,330
There are a few rooms
upstairs and downstairs.

212
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,750
Talpade, give me the update.

213
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,160
We are tracking down the safe
houses of the informants,

214
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,120
rebel sympathizers and rebels.

215
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,660
We've forwarded a request to have

216
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,620
checkpoints in all of
Chennai's entry points…

217
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,500
airport, railway stations,
and the bus terminuses,

218
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,500
to the headquarters, sir.

219
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,120
Sir, once the local agencies
send us their surveillance data…

220
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I can start facial recognition mapping.

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,330
When will the surveillance report come in?

222
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,040
Should be getting it by this evening.

223
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,620
Okay. Look, guys. We aren't just…

224
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,250
tracking the rebels
and their sympathizers.

225
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,250
We are also tracking all
the ISI-backed sleeper cells.

226
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,910
Got it?

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
Get on with the job!

228
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,120
Punit!

229
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,750
-Punit!
-Yes, sir?

230
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,250
Is the threat analysis report ready?

231
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,540
-When do you need it, sir?
-Well, I needed it yesterday.

232
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,950
If you gave it today,
I would be eternally grateful!

233
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,000
Hey, rascala!

234
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,660
Drink some coffee, be alert,

235
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,370
-and get down to business!
-That's right, JK!

236
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,830
Tamil Nadu means drinking filter coffee

237
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,250
and calling everyone
"yennada rascala," right?

238
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,950
I am just kidding, man!
Relax! Take it easy!

239
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,000
-Thambi!
-Don't call him "Thambi!"

240
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,450
His name is Velu.

241
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,450
Alright, Velu.

242
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,950
Filter coffee?

243
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,450
I am going for a shower.

244
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,750
Calm down, bro!

245
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,830
There's no water supply
here from 8 AM to 8 PM.

246
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,790
Either bathe at night
or early in the morning.

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There was a flood here five years ago.

248
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,450
And now, there's no water.

249
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,200
Are you okay?

250
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,620
I am on a break.

251
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,040
After 16 years of married life,
I am on a break.

252
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,700
How is the team?

253
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,250
Muthu and his team are smart,

254
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,120
but the information we need…

255
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,160
is not there in any of our systems.

256
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,160
I know a guy.

257
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,000
-Chellam?
-Yes.

258
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,910
He went underground
after the Subbu incident.

259
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,700
He is on ghost mode now.

260
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,160
I've never met a more
paranoid man in my life.

261
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,660
But how will we contact him?

262
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,120
Come, sit.

263
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,160
Brother Selva!

264
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,950
How are you?

265
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,750
Are you both ready for the mission?

266
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,500
We have been waiting for this day.

267
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,950
Also…

268
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,620
Raji will be leading this mission.

269
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,120
Raji?

270
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,660
Is she alive?

271
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,870
Our Chief, Bhaskaran,
has hand-picked each one of us.

272
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,000
There are many assignments
in this mission.

273
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,660
It doesn't matter who leads.

274
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,080
It is critical for us to work as a team.

275
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,000
This is Sajid.

276
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,870
Chief has sent him. Be respectful.

277
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,830
Sajid… this is Karthik.

278
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,120
And this is Prabhu.

279
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,580
Raji!

280
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,290
Raji!

281
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,660
So good to see you!

282
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,790
You've put on weight!

283
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,290
It'll be gone in a week.

284
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,540
-How are you?
-I am okay.

285
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,870
-Have a seat.
-Come.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,620
Sajid, this is Raji.

287
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,160
The most important part of our plan.

288
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,040
All of you, listen carefully.

289
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,000
Memorize all the details of the plan.

290
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't talk to anyone about it. Understood?

291
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,750
And memorize this address.

292
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,540
Tigris Aviation Flying School.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,250
How is everything going, Raji?

294
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,410
I am okay, brother. Getting by.

295
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,620
Any news about your mom?

296
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,120
Yes. Four years back, I got to know that
she was in a refugee camp in Trincomalee.

297
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,200
She killed herself last year.

298
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,660
She was mentally unstable, I heard.

299
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,450
How our people continue to suffer!

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,330
I see the shattered face…

301
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,370
of my dead brother every night.

302
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,620
Raji… everything is going
according to plan, right?

303
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,700
I hope you have not raised any suspicions.

304
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,080
-Brother.
-Yes?

305
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,080
Nothing. Never mind.

306
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,620
What's on your mind, Raji? Any problem?

307
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,870
No. Nothing I can't handle.

308
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,540
I hope you are ready
for the mission, Raji.

309
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
This is the only reason
I am alive, brother.

310
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Fish, fish, fish!

311
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Come here, sister! Fresh fish, sister!

312
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,250
Will Hindi work here?

313
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,950
Just because you speak Hindi,
doesn't mean the entire world does.

314
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,870
Come, come. Fish, fish, fish!

315
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,000
Hello. One minute.

316
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,750
(speaking broken Tamil)
We are making stingray curry on Sunday.

317
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,410
We'll buy it even if its tail is missing.

318
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,620
(speaking broken Tamil)
We are making stingray curry on Sunday.

319
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,870
We'll buy it even if its tail is missing.

320
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,290
These idiots are talking shit in Hindi!

321
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,830
What?

322
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,870
Hello!

323
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,910
Come here.

324
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,950
-Hello.
-What's up?

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
(speaking broken Tamil)

326
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,870
-Stingray?
-Stingray! Stingray!

327
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,580
Only the captain of the MV Kamath has it.

328
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,410
I am Srikant Tiwari.

329
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,700
Tell the captain…

330
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,620
meet personally.

331
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,290
Give stingray.

332
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,790
Urgent!

333
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,370
Dhriti, what should I cook today?

334
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,500
Dhriti!

335
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,910
-Dhriti!
-What?

336
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,700
I asked you something, baby.
What should I cook?

337
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,200
I am not hungry, Mom!

338
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,830
Why? Did you eat something
before coming home?

339
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,910
Tell me, what should I cook?

340
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,370
Make whatever you want!
I'll eat it later in my room!

341
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,410
Don't you remember what Dad said?

342
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,370
We have to eat together
as a family, correct?

343
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Then, where is he?

344
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,620
Atharv! Enough of the video games!

345
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,040
Will you stop messaging me?

346
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,700
Isn't it clear that I am not
replying because I don't want to talk?

347
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,000
What the fuck!

348
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,330
You act all lovey-dovey
and then, you start ghosting me!

349
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,950
What is wrong with you?

350
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,290
You didn't even have the decency
to tell me what happened!

351
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,830
Listen!

352
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,660
Things aren't that easy over here, okay?

353
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,370
And…

354
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,080
there are many things in my life that…

355
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,700
I can't do anything about.
I can't help it.

356
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,620
Whatever it is!

357
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,200
Do you know how shitty it is to be treated
like this, and then, you disappear?

358
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,500
Like, how!

359
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,080
See, the thing is,
I already have many problems in my family.

360
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,870
And…

361
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,660
especially my father.

362
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,620
He found out that I am seeing someone.

363
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,870
So, before it became worse, I thought…

364
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,450
I thought… I am not going to talk to you.

365
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,450
He just wants me to focus
on my studies and just…

366
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,500
family business, you know?

367
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,000
So, I am not asking you
to marry me tomorrow!

368
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,910
Idiot!

369
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,290
I don't deserve this!

370
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,290
This is not correct.
Why are you doing this?

371
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,160
Listen, I am sorry.
I know I've made mistakes.

372
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,250
But what I feel for you…

373
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,910
is real.

374
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,250
Trust me on this.

375
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,950
Go to hell!

376
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,290
Excuse me.

377
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,000
"Oh, my forlorn heart, what ails you?

378
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,910
What is the medicine for my blues?

379
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,410
Those, who you expect to be faithful…

380
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,620
don't know what…

381
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,080
-Faith is!
-faith is!"

382
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,830
Well said!

383
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,160
So, you're in the mood for poetry?

384
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,870
Why don't you drink some
water if you're so thirsty?

385
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,250
This is flavored water.

386
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,370
And it's not like I need to go
home, for fuck's sake.

387
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,790
Hey, sad sack!

388
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,540
You guys just had a fight, not a divorce.

389
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,450
Why don't you try talking to her?

390
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,410
What the hell were you thinking?

391
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,580
In your relationship,
do you realize how absent you were

392
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,160
-and how present she was? Think about it.
-Shut up!

393
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,040
This isn't any attendance for a class!

394
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,950
Present, sir! Absent, sir!

395
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,500
Look, Tiwari.

396
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,200
All I know is that the two of you--

397
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,040
Let's not talk about this right now.

398
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,040
Listen to me!

399
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,660
-The two of you--
-Now, don't ruin my evening!

400
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,040
-I am just trying to--
-I am not interested in--

401
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,080
Shut up!

402
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,120
All I know is that both
of you love each other.

403
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,160
And after my parents,
you two are my only family.

404
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,700
And I can't stand
watching my family fight.

405
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,330
Where are the tears, motherfucker!

406
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,290
You don't value me at all.

407
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,160
Give me your phone!

408
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,750
-Give me your phone!
-No! Let it go!

409
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,830
Don't open Suchi's messages.

410
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,160
If she sees a blue tick,
she'll know I've read them.

411
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,330
-Have you changed your password?
-Open it now!

412
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,950
-Tell me your password!
-No! Fucking open it now!

413
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,000
-Show me your face!
-No, no! Open it yourself!

414
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,290
Just show me your damned face!

415
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,120
Who is it?

416
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,160
We've managed to contact him.

417
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,660
Chellam!

418
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,250
It's so fucking hot. I can't sleep.

419
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,250
All good?

420
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,000
JK, what the hell are we doing?

421
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,790
You mean, right now?

422
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,250
Or in life?

423
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,830
How can we say that we're the good guys?

424
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,410
What right do we have to claim
that we save people's lives?

425
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Have you gone mad?

426
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,790
Of course, we're the good guys.

427
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,200
And of course, we have saved many lives.

428
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,040
Why are you lying to yourself?

429
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,620
Remember what happened at Orion?

430
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,620
We failed.

431
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,450
They just twisted the facts
and made up a story.

432
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,500
That it was an accident.
That it was a gas leak.

433
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,000
And the mission was successful.

434
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,370
But our mission was a success.

435
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,000
What about the 48 people who died?

436
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,620
And all those others
who were hospitalized?

437
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,580
-Those lives don't matter?
-Look.

438
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,790
We have saved thousands of lives.

439
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Imagine what would have happened
if the gas leak wasn't stopped.

440
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,500
Yes, we lost the battle.

441
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
But we won the war.

442
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,120
Come, let us smoke our blues away.

443
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,290
Sorry, there was traffic, so…

444
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,950
If you'd carried on like
this for another two days…

445
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,910
then I would have said,
"Fuck you" and moved on.

446
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,450
My psycho mode of calls and
messages lasts only a week.

447
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,200
Wow!

448
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,870
This is the first time I've
heard you use the "F-word."

449
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,790
Well, I was fucking hurting!
What did you expect--

450
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,410
Okay, calm down!
Just calm down, okay? Please.

451
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,250
Please, calm down.

452
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,500
See, honestly,
I wasn't going to meet you again.

453
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,290
-See! You never wanted to--
-Just let me speak, please.

454
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,750
The reason being my dad.

455
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,910
He's a very strict person.

456
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,200
He keeps checking my messages, my calls…

457
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,700
all the time.

458
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,580
He even has my email ID and password.

459
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,620
What the hell!

460
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,120
At times, I am just…

461
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,370
I am just scared, but…

462
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,080
Do you like me?

463
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,870
Dhriti!

464
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,790
Yes or no?

465
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,410
Yes, of course, I like you.

466
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,080
Then, we'll figure it out.

467
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,450
If I can smile, so can you!

468
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,950
Yeah, but it's not that easy.

469
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,660
In a couple of years, we'll be adults.

470
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,200
It's our life!

471
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,660
Do you want to come home?

472
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,790
Chief, we have acquired the asset.

473
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,580
We shall take to the skies soon.

474
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,040
Have you activated the eagle?

475
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,330
Yes, Chief.
The eagle is ready for the hunt.

476
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,000
Is Sajid with you?

477
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,950
Yes.

478
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,620
Someone wants to talk to him.

479
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,410
Greetings!

480
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,750
Greetings!

481
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,540
All well?

482
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,450
Yes.

483
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,790
I hope the place and the bird are alright.

484
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,250
Yes, they're just what
we need to achieve our goal.

485
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,830
Which bird are you flying?

486
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,910
The smaller one.

487
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,370
It can fly pretty low.

488
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,700
I've sent you a gift.

489
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,080
Did you receive it?

490
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,330
Yes.

491
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,330
Goodbye.

492
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,290
When are your mom and dad coming back?

493
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,830
This is my uncle's apartment.

494
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,830
I stay beyond Vikhroli, but I come
to stay here every now and then.

495
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,580
Are you boys allergic to staying clean?

496
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,620
Well, I am not.

497
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,830
But I think my uncle is.

498
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,870
Is your uncle Muslim?

499
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,040
No, actually, it's a rented apartment.

500
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
Juice?

501
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,450
Yeah.

502
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,910
All boys are the same.

503
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,870
What about this room?

504
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,120
That's my uncle's room.

505
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,790
He keeps it locked when he's not around.

506
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,450
It's really bad.

507
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,120
-Bad?
-Yeah. Taste.

508
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,620
Not a good idea.

509
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,290
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

510
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,910
Shit! I thought my uncle wouldn't
be home until late at night!

511
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,580
-Come on, let's go!
-Chill! What happened?

512
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,040
-Why are you so scared?
-I'll explain later.

513
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,790
-Why are you so scared?
-I'll be back in five minutes, stay here!

514
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,290
-What's up, brother?
-I forgot my keys.

515
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,290
-What took you so long?
-I was in the kitchen.

516
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,450
What were you doing there?

517
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,080
Have you seen my keys?

518
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,330
This bag?

519
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,200
Whose is it?

520
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,040
I am asking you a question!
Whose bag is this?

521
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,540
Who the hell have you brought here?

522
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,000
Answer me! Who is it?

523
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,750
-Hi!
-She's my friend.

524
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,750
This is my uncle, Shyam.

525
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,250
Hi… homework…

526
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,580
I had an assignment to do, so…

527
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,950
Anyway, Kalyan, I think it's late.
I should go.

528
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,870
Mom will start calling soon.

529
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,160
Bye.

530
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,080
Bye.

531
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,000
Bye.

532
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,910
Are you fucking nuts?

533
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,040
You think you can bring
whoever you want here?

534
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,200
It's not what you think.
This is a part of Sajid's mission.

535
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,540
This is part of his mission!
You fucking piece of shit!

536
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,540
Fucking around is a part of which mission?

537
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,540
I'll talk to Sajid…

538
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,370
and tell him exactly
what the fuck you're up to!

539
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,200
I am sorry! Please! I am so sorry!

540
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,750
What is on the menu?

541
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,910
Idli, dosa, pongal, vada.

542
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,830
One-one plate, each.

543
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,160
-Okay, sir.
-Thank you so much!

544
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,160
You've just ordered for yourself?

545
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,080
-Brother! Two plates, each!
-Okay, sir.

546
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,580
What a wimp, this Chellam!

547
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,500
We've been dying in this
fucking heat for an hour!

548
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,370
No sign of him!

549
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,580
Doesn't value our time!

550
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,040
Fucking idiot!

551
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,620
If something happens to this wimp…

552
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,500
then I won't be able to help you.

553
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,750
Don't turn.

554
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,330
Pick up this newspaper once I leave.

555
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,200
This has the list of the safe
houses used by the rebels.

556
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,870
But we'll need you…

557
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,910
Quite a filmy chap!

558
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,870
-Let's go!
-But--

559
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,410
Pay him, quick!

560
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,870
He hardly ever spoke to us, ma'am,
but he was a nice guy.

561
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,500
-Did he have trouble with someone--
-Ma'am.

562
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,790
She wants to talk to you.

563
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,160
You can go.

564
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,700
Go ahead.

565
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,750
Tell me.

566
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,000
Ma'am, Mr. Nanda really liked Raji.

567
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,370
Raji?

568
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,500
Rajalekshmi, ma'am.
You interviewed her yesterday.

569
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,790
This one.

570
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,450
Why do you say Nanda really likes Raji?

571
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,620
It was pretty obvious, ma'am.

572
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,080
Does Raji know about this?

573
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,500
She is disgusted by it.

574
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,700
But that day, she got into his car.

575
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,160
Okay, thanks. You can go.

576
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,250
Okay, ma'am.

577
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,410
Get that girl.

578
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,540
Looks like she didn't report
for work today, ma'am.

579
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,040
Oh.

580
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,790
-You have her address, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

581
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,750
There! That's 150!

582
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,250
Peanuts! Peanuts!

583
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,580
Who's there?

584
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,500
Is this Rajalekshmi's house?

585
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,250
No.

586
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,620
Have you seen this girl?

587
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,700
No.

588
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,660
Are you sure?

589
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,410
I have lived here for 50 years.

590
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,540
I have never seen this girl.

591
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,450
I want the last known location
of Rajalekshmi's phone.

592
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,410
Now!

593
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,120
Okay, got it.

594
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,370
Head to Adambakkam.

595
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,790
Isn't the last known location
for Nanda's phone also Adambakkam?

596
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,830
Nanda and Raji are up to some shit.

597
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,330
We should lock these shit-heads
up and beat the crap out of them!

598
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,830
What do you mean it'll take two days?

599
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,830
Sri, without judicial permission,
we can't use the local police.

600
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,750
We have a list of the safe
houses used by the rebels!

601
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,410
It is a time-sensitive situation!

602
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,410
And you're explaining to me
about bureaucracy here?

603
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,410
Tiwari!

604
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,290
He hasn't made these rules.

605
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,080
And you're aware of the state machinery.
What can he do?

606
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,580
All this red tapism has fucked our case!

607
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,950
Okay, can we go check
those safe houses ourselves?

608
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,750
This is not advisable, Sri.

609
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,750
All right, let's go!

610
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,660
Go and meet everyone
in the homes listed here.

611
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,700
It's a rebel safe house,
so keep a low profile.

612
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,370
You guys take care of that side.

613
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,790
Check the shop out.

614
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,040
How many corners does this street have?

615
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,410
No idea?

616
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,200
Check in the adjacent street.

617
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,370
-Have you seen this girl?
-No, ma'am. I have never seen her.

618
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,000
-Have you seen her?
-No, ma'am.

619
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,950
That side!

620
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,040
It is locked!

621
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,910
-Look at this photo. Have you seen her?
-No.

622
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,870
-Have you seen her?
-I've seen her.

623
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,450
-Where?
-Over there.

624
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,830
-Which house is it?
-That one, there.

625
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,830
Is there nobody in the next house?

626
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,540
Going somewhere, sweetheart?

627
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,660
Why did you lie to me?

628
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,620
-Do you love him?
-He's a son of a bitch!

629
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,370
Did he do something to you?

630
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,750
If women started speaking out,
all men would be in jail.

631
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,250
And then, nobody would give us jobs.

632
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,370
When did you last see Nanda?

633
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,160
Two days ago.

634
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,750
And then?

635
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,910
He came home, but then left immediately.

636
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,160
Where do you think he will be?

637
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,370
I am not the only one. There are others.

638
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,580
Oh, yeah?

639
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,410
Do you have names?

640
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,950
Isn't it enough to live with this shame?

641
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,450
Now, you expect me to know
about the others too?

642
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,660
Why don't you ask him?

643
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,080
Are you ready to file a complaint?

644
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,580
If you want to file a complaint,
let me know.

645
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,790
I'll take care of the rest.

646
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,950
You lied to me about something else.

647
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,910
What, ma'am?

648
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,120
Your address.

649
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,330
My uncle got me the job,
I don't know what address he gave.

650
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,830
What is this? This chemical smell?

651
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,000
It's from the drainage behind my house.
I've gotten used to it.

652
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,910
The drainage stinks of
all kinds of rubbish, ma'am.

653
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,290
What's in the bag?

654
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,580
Garbage.

655
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,160
Don't leave town without my permission.

656
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,620
Report to the station daily.

657
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,580
Where? Sure, I'll tell her.

658
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,120
Ma'am, they've found a body in Adambakkam.

659
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,500
They want us to check if it's Nanda.

660
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,700
-Where is the body?
-G. H., ma'am.

661
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:47,790
Go there.

662
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,450
Call Nanda's wife and
ask her to come to G. H.

663
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,660
This way.

664
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,700
Doctor?

665
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
This isn't him.

666
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,620
Come, ma'am. Let me get you some water.

667
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,290
What is this smell? I know this smell.

668
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,410
That's formalin.

669
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,870
It's used to prevent
the body from decomposing.

670
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,160
Send a backup unit to Adambakkam!

671
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,950
Ma'am, ma'am! Sorry!

672
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,450
1082. Where?

673
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,330
This? This? Okay. Thank you.

674
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:58,910
Hands up!

675
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,660
Don't move or I'll kill you!

676
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,250
We are fucked.

677
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,370
What the hell are you looking at?

678
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,370
Murderers! Don't act all innocent!
