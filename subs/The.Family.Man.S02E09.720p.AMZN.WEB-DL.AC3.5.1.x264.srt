1
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,583
Have you seen this man?

2
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,541
Yes, I have.

3
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,083
Are you sure?

4
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,791
Yes, sir. He lives in that building.

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,375
Hello, control room.

6
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:47,541
Yeah.

7
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,166
Alert all units. I'll be there soon.

8
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,500
-Has anybody visited him?
-Yes, sir.

9
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,583
-What's the update?
-Sir!

10
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,750
He claims that the target
is in block number two.

11
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,083
Mr. Shinde!

12
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,041
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,541
I'm going to need your help.

14
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:24,791
Okay, sir.

15
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,333
Syed.

16
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,208
Sir, the water supply will be shut
from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. tomorrow.

17
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,833
Please, stock some water
so that there is no trouble.

18
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,375
-Alright.
-Okay? Thank you, sir.

19
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,125
-Was it the watchman?
-Yes.

20
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,125
-Have you seen him before?
-No.

21
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,958
-Yes?
-Sir, it's confirmed.

22
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,416
-There's another guy there, too.
-Who?

23
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,000
Sajid.

24
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,833
Sajid?

25
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,583
Boss! Something's wrong.

26
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,125
-We have to leave.
-Motherfucker!

27
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,166
First, we finish our job.

28
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,791
Then, we leave. Get your stuff.

29
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,791
I can't let the girl live.

30
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,791
Fucking hell!

31
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,833
Take your position.

32
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,333
Block all the exits.

33
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,041
Go! Go! Go! Go! Hurry up!

34
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,083
Let it go!

35
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,500
Come with me!

36
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,541
-We don't have time for this!
-Damn it!

37
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:45,750
Come on.

38
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,166
Check there!

39
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,625
Dhriti!

40
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,375
-Dad!
-Hey!

41
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,333
Dhriti!

42
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,000
-Dhriti! Open the door!
-Dad!

43
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,708
Don't cry. Dad is here.

44
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,875
Dad is here. Dad is here.

45
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,083
Be strong, okay? Be strong.

46
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,750
-Ajit, take her to the hospital.
-No!

47
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,375
-My child, Uncle Ajit is there.
-No, no, please!

48
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,666
-I'm there. I'm there.
-No, Dad. Please!

49
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,208
-Dhriti!
-Come on! Come on! Come on!

50
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,708
I'm coming! I'm coming!

51
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,458
I'm coming very soon.
He'll take you safely.

52
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,541
-Did you find them?
-No, sir. We're still looking.

53
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,125
I want him captured! Got it?
Hurry up, guys!

54
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,208
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

55
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,083
Sir, man down.

56
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,666
Push the target from both sides.

57
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,416
-Bring him towards the center.
-Yes, sir.

58
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,291
-Green team.
-Yes, sir.

59
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,625
-Take positions.
-Yes, sir.

60
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,166
Come on! Move!

61
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,916
Sajid!

62
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,291
You've been surrounded!

63
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,541
Surrender now, and save your life!

64
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,250
There's no way out of this!

65
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,708
Do you understand me?

66
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,708
There's no way out!

67
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,375
Surrender!

68
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:35,791
Drop your weapon!

69
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,333
Drop it!

70
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
Drop the gun! Drop it, Sajid!

71
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,125
He's dead.

72
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,791
Call an ambulance.

73
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:24,833
Okay, sir.

74
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,875
Hurry up.

75
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
We should have captured him alive.

76
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,791
Why? Did you see what he did to Dhriti?

77
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,041
He knew everything about the rebels' plan.

78
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,583
What? You are still
thinking about the mission?

79
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,958
You should be careful at the station.

80
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,500
Check over there, as well.

81
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,666
We're still here,
but the plane is missing.

82
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,375
Anyway, any news about JK?

83
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,000
No, sir. We are still looking for him.

84
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:20,791
Okay.

85
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,750
Look into my eyes!

86
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,833
There is no pain.

87
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,625
No pain.

88
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,375
No--

89
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,791
No pain?

90
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,166
I want to talk to your
sister, so off you go!

91
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,375
You can call me an "asshole" anytime.

92
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,666
How are you feeling now?

93
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,250
Dad…

94
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,041
I've killed a human being.

95
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,625
You killed a terrorist.

96
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,166
Dhriti.

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,958
Kalyan aka Salman… was a terrorist.

98
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,416
He was brainwashed and recruited
to kill innocent people.

99
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,458
Stop feeling guilty. You're very brave.

100
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,750
And he's still alive.

101
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:37,875
Really?

102
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,750
He's in the government hospital.

103
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,666
He'll be sent to jail
as soon as he recovers.

104
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,250
So, all these years, you
lied about your job?

105
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,208
Dhriti.

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,291
He had to lie about his job
because it was a dangerous one.

107
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,708
Both of you were too young
to understand these things.

108
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:03,916
So, we decided to keep it
a secret till you got older.

109
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,208
I wanted to protect you guys.

110
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:13,083
I didn't want to endanger your lives.

111
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,416
But I have failed, and I am so sorry.

112
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
No, Dad. You didn't.

113
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,625
You are the coolest dad in the world.

114
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,875
Thank you.

115
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,583
What did the doctor say?

116
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,958
After what she's been through,
she needs immediate counseling.

117
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,750
Did he…

118
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,250
I mean, with Dhriti… did he…

119
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,041
did he force himself on her in any way?

120
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,541
-No, no. Not at all.
-Thank God!

121
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,208
-Is he really alive?
-Who?

122
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,375
Whatever his name is… Kalyan… Salman.

123
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,916
He's dead.

124
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,833
Is it really important
for you to go to Chennai?

125
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,416
Can't JK handle things for a few days?

126
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,541
-JK is missing.
-What?

127
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,875
What happened? Is everything okay?

128
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,333
He's just a drama queen. He'll be alright.

129
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,291
I think, he's like a cockroach.

130
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,791
He can survive in any situation.

131
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,458
Come back soon.

132
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,083
Yeah.

133
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,958
Sir, we have found traces of C4.

134
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,916
Judging by the size of the crates,
it would weigh about 200 kilos, sir.

135
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,791
-Thank you, just excuse me.
-Okay, sir.

136
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,208
Yes, Sri.

137
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,791
Muthu, I am coming to Chennai.

138
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,958
I'll be there in roughly three hours.

139
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,333
Any news of JK?

140
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:47,958
No.

141
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:49,875
Still searching.

142
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,708
Any leads?

143
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,833
If he's been shot or he's injured…

144
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,666
then by now, there must have
been a lot of blood loss.

145
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,541
Not really sure, Sri.

146
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:03,833
How's your daughter?

147
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,375
She's… she's fine.

148
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,166
What's the update from forensics?

149
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,458
They have just found traces of C4.

150
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,125
There was a trainer aircraft,
but now it is missing.

151
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,916
I've spoken to the air traffic control,

152
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,541
and they have no record
of any aircraft taking off.

153
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,041
A plane is missing?

154
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,291
They will be searching for the plane.

155
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,750
We will have to get off the highway.

156
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,833
They will be searching the skies.

157
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,791
But you're right.

158
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,416
After we cross the city limits,
we will get off the highway.

159
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,041
Sir, he's here.

160
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,208
I found him.

161
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,666
The address is on the back.

162
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,375
Thank you.

163
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,666
Hello, Mr. Sambit.

164
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,625
He's in Normandy, France.

165
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,333
I'll text you his address.

166
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,583
Silence. We are approaching a checkpoint.

167
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,833
License and RC book, please.

168
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,583
What's there in the vehicle?

169
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,708
Sir! There is nothing at the back.

170
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,791
Just farm equipment, sir. That's it.

171
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,750
Open it up!

172
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,541
No. There's nothing important, sir.

173
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,125
Don't just look at me, open it!

174
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,291
What is this?

175
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,583
It is a windmill, sir.

176
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,208
For our farm.

177
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,041
Where are you headed?

178
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,500
Hosur, sir.

179
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,000
Where is the transit permit?

180
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:15,958
Sir?

181
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,500
Transit permit!

182
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,000
For transporting industrial
equipment, you need a transit permit!

183
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,333
What are you looking at?

184
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,416
Sir, we are small-time farmers.

185
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,208
Big or small,
rules are the same for everyone!

186
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,666
Come back and collect the truck when
you have a permit! Leave the vehicle!

187
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,541
What are you both blabbering?

188
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,500
No, sir.

189
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,583
Are you teaching me how to do my job?

190
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,291
Grab the keys and park it on the side!

191
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,375
They teach me, it seems!

192
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,875
She seems quite modern.
Is she from Bangalore?

193
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,416
Sir?

194
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,583
Shifting the plane by
road was a clever move.

195
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:53,875
Good job, Selva.

196
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,583
That was smart thinking on your feet.

197
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,000
Chief, are we going to stop the mission?

198
00:19:59,083 --> 00:19:59,958
No.

199
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,666
We'll never get a chance like this again.

200
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,833
Now, listen to me carefully.

201
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,875
There's a place called Kicha Farms,

202
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,833
about ten kilometers
from Sunguvarsathiram.

203
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,208
Krishnan Ramaswamy owns it.
I've had a word with him.

204
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,791
You can use his farm as a base.

205
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,708
There will be a stretch there.

206
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,166
You can use that as the runway.

207
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,291
He has provided some
men who will help you.

208
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,791
Set up the base quickly,
and finish the job.

209
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:22,750
Okay, Chief!

210
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,208
Come here!

211
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,416
Tell us where you found this phone!

212
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,791
Sir, I don't know anything.
Let go of me, sir.

213
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,833
I said I don't know.

214
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,166
Put him in the vehicle.

215
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,291
Get in.

216
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,833
Get him out.

217
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,208
Bring him.

218
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,250
Where?

219
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,333
Take him away!

220
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,833
Doctor, come here quickly!

221
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,500
Doctor, check on him.

222
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,875
Muthu!

223
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,166
Muthu!

224
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,541
Sir!

225
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,666
-How is he?
-I am checking.

226
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,750
How is JK?

227
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,458
Come quickly!

228
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,666
-Muthu, man! Let me talk!
-Sri!

229
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,833
Is he alive?

230
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,208
Checking, sir.

231
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,291
Talk to him.

232
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,875
-Easy, easy.
-How bad is he?

233
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,708
What injuries has he sustained?

234
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,250
He was shot in the back.

235
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,708
Doctor, can you feel a pulse?

236
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,000
Give me a minute, I'm checking.

237
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,041
Still checking, sir.

238
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,750
Say something! Say something, goddammit!

239
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,416
There is a pulse, but very weak.

240
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,666
He has a pulse. Get him to the
nearest hospital right away!

241
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,250
And I want hourly updates.

242
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:17,791
Okay.

243
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,291
They stopped construction
of the highway here…

244
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,041
because they didn't vote for the MLA.

245
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,375
You have about
a 600-meter stretch of land.

246
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,833
Will that be enough, Raji?

247
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Don't have a choice.

248
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,666
We can fly.

249
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,750
-Excuse me, JK Talpade.
-End of the corridor, sir.

250
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,666
Excuse me, doctor.

251
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,916
Hi, I'm Srikant Tiwari.
JK Talpade's friend.

252
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,375
How is he doing? Is he out of danger?

253
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,375
He should be out of the ICU by tomorrow.

254
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,875
Thankfully, the bullet didn't
harm his spinal cord,

255
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,625
and we were able to pull the
bullet out without any difficulty.

256
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,708
Is his family on the way?

257
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,916
We are his family.

258
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,875
-You want to see him?
-Can we?

259
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,916
If you don't mind, just one person.

260
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,958
Just keep it short. He needs to rest.

261
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,291
Sure. I appreciate it, sir.

262
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,625
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

263
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,000
We have sent the test to the lab.

264
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,375
We will get it in about an hour.

265
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,041
What are you doing, man?

266
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,791
-Muthu?
-He's outside.

267
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,375
-Dhriti?
-She's okay.

268
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:48,583
I really felt like
I wasn't going to make it.

269
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,416
I swear!

270
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,583
Motherfucker, the next time
you go on a raid by yourself,

271
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:55,833
I'll shoot you myself.

272
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,500
Stop crying, asshole.

273
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,458
I'm still alive.

274
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,083
Pushpa!

275
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,375
-I hate tears.
-Motherfucker!

276
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,375
How is Suchi?

277
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,166
Do you really need everyone's
status update right now, fucker?

278
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,000
He needs to relax.

279
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,666
Sorry. I'll be out.

280
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:22,875
Okay.

281
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,541
Go to sleep.

282
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,000
Get some rest.

283
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,750
Tread carefully with Raji.

284
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:31,583
Don't worry.

285
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,166
My ass has never been shot, got it?

286
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,250
I'm too smart for that.

287
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,333
Tiwari.

288
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,916
Check this out!

289
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,500
Prabhu, Karthik,
until we finish the mission,

290
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:54,000
I want the entire perimeter under watch.

291
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:58,083
And the three of us will take turns
to keep watch through the night.

292
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,791
Okay.

293
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,375
Raji, get some rest.

294
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,375
Tomorrow is your day.

295
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,041
Eat, Raji.

296
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,416
I don't want my soldiers to be weak.

297
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,916
I still remember the day
Chief and I found you.

298
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,208
The same fire still burns in your eyes.

299
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,500
Raji, it is time to make them pay

300
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,375
for all the injustice and
suffering that they gave you.

301
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,000
Yes.

302
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,583
You are my best weapon, Raji.

303
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,291
What you are about to do…

304
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,375
will inspire our cadre
to take up arms again.

305
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,250
You are about to reboot the movement.

306
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,250
I will miss you.

307
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,625
The movement will miss you.

308
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,375
I hope Sajid succeeds in his
mission, as well.

309
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,541
What's the matter?

310
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:10,333
He didn't make it.

311
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,458
Have they arrested him?

312
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,625
I am a British citizen! You are mistaken!

313
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:10,875
You are under arrest!

314
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,916
Don't move!
Put your hands behind your back!

315
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,416
You don't have the jurisdiction!

316
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,416
-Stop moving!
-Hey! You bastards!

317
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,083
I'm from the embassy.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

318
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,500
You've got the wrong guy!

319
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,333
-Bastards!
-Cooperate with us!

320
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,375
Bhaskaran!

321
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,500
It's all over.

322
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,666
Your grand plan is going to fail.

323
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:35,166
France has put their plan to recognize
our government on hold.

324
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:38,166
All thanks to you and your stupidity.

325
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,875
Where is Raji?

326
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,666
Tell me and make things
easier for everyone.

327
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
This is your last chance
to redeem yourself.

328
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,875
France and the UK have agreed
to hand you over to India.

329
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,750
It is all over, Bhaskaran.

330
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,625
So, where is Raji and
what exactly is your plan?

331
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,291
I don't have any plan, Deepan.

332
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,791
Bhaskaran,
I have worked with you for 30 years.

333
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,625
I know you.

334
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,250
Start talking now,
and we can end this amicably.

335
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,875
Or else…

336
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,625
This is how you choose
to repay the sacrifices…

337
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,375
made by our brothers and sisters?

338
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,625
Bhaskaran, please!

339
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:22,416
I want the same thing as you,
for our homeland to be free.

340
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,083
I am tired of your romance with war.

341
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,750
If you look closely, we aren't different.

342
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,541
There is a difference between you and me.

343
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,250
There is a big difference.

344
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,458
You are a politician.

345
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:38,875
And I am a soldier.

346
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:44,041
Martyrs never die.

347
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:48,083
Hey! Stop him!

348
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,625
Bhaskaran! What have you done?

349
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,041
Stop him! Quick! Stop him!

350
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,166
Bhaskaran!

351
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,833
What are you doing? Stop!

352
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:56,791
Bhaskaran!

353
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,625
Prime Minister Basu
has arrived in Chennai.

354
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,083
She is on her way to meet…

355
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:13,041
the Sri Lankan President, Lasit Rupatunga.

356
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,791
With this meeting, Prime Minister Basu…

357
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,458
will flag off her Build India campaign…

358
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:21,666
by announcing
the Northern Sri Lanka port deal.

359
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:25,500
We are joined by the senior
business editor, Mr. Vinay Pradhan.

360
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,250
-Welcome to the show, sir.
-Thank you.

361
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,958
So, Mr. Pradhan,
why is this meeting significant?

362
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,666
See, this port deal is
of huge strategic value to India…

363
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,708
as it keeps China out of the Indian Ocean.

364
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:39,000
It furthers our Prime Minister
Basu's agenda of Build India.

365
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:42,375
But is she willing to sacrifice
the vote bank of an entire state?

366
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,916
We are doing everything
we can to find this plane.

367
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,375
This is ridiculous!

368
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,750
We can't find a plane?

369
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,666
These rebels are very smart.

370
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,750
Any possibility of them
having gone underground?

371
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,333
Or do you think they are still active?

372
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,375
I am totally convinced
that they are still active.

373
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,625
Otherwise,
why would Bhaskaran kill himself…

374
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,416
rather than reveal their whereabouts?

375
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,375
Anyhow.

376
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,458
You focus on these remaining rebels.

377
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,375
No matter where they are
hiding, you need to find them.

378
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,750
Nothing can go wrong.

379
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:15,750
Tamilians have never warmed
up to a national party.

380
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,291
And Basu desperately wants to change that.

381
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:22,041
But this show of camaraderie
with President Rupatunga…

382
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:24,458
Ma'am, President Rupatunga
has arrived at the airport.

383
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,666
He's on his way to the hotel.

384
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,250
-Sit.
-Thank you.

385
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,833
Would you like some tea?

386
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:34,833
It's okay, ma'am.

387
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,583
How is Dhriti?

388
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,875
She's feeling much better. Thank you.

389
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,958
JK?

390
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,750
We just got back from the hospital, sir.

391
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:43,833
We got lucky.

392
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,458
The doctor is saying that
he should recover quickly.

393
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,416
That's very good news, Srikant.

394
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,625
Yesterday, we got to Bhaskaran…

395
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,541
but before we could question
him, he killed himself.

396
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,291
Find that plane, Sri,
and make sure it doesn't take off.

397
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:03,791
These people are confident that they'll
be able to stop any kind of attack.

398
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:07,166
But we know that as far as
the rebels are concerned…

399
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,583
we cannot leave anything to chance.

400
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,125
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

401
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,208
Those, who don't care about their own
lives, are certainly more dangerous.

402
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,875
It's a goddamn plane! Not a motorcycle!

403
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,541
How can it go missing?

404
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,958
Sir, my fear is that they
may have dumped the plane…

405
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,916
and now,
they are mobile with that much C4.

406
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,958
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.

407
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,916
Sri, I think I have some news.

408
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,291
I know what they did to the plane.

409
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:44,375
What?

410
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,916
They have dismantled it.

411
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,291
What?

412
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,625
I just spoke to a senior
air force officer.

413
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,791
He used to serve in Sri Lanka.

414
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:54,750
The rebel air force was
created by sourcing planes…

415
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,833
from smaller African countries.

416
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,666
They used to dismantle the planes,

417
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,125
and smuggle them into Sri Lanka, via sea.

418
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,541
In the same way,
they may have dismantled the plane…

419
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:08,416
and transported it via truck or something!

420
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,833
What are the routes out of Tigris?

421
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,291
Tigris Aviation is on the highway, here.

422
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:18,000
They probably headed
west, towards Bangalore.

423
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,041
-Okay.
-That's my number one guess.

424
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,166
Another possibility is that they could
have gone north or come down south…

425
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,083
towards Pondicherry.

426
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,791
There's a small chance that
they could have turned around…

427
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:31,125
to reenter the city, and then
taken some other exit route.

428
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,041
Raise the red alert.

429
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,458
Send your teams to all the checkpoints.

430
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:41,166
Brief everyone that there may be
a truck carrying a dismantled plane, okay?

431
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,833
Punit! Monitor the situation! As soon as
you have a lead, alert me, ASAP!

432
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,750
Okay? Let's go!

433
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,125
Okay! Both of you! Cover North Chennai!
All the areas near Gummidipundi!

434
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,375
-Yes, sir.
-You cover South Chennai!

435
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,666
-Everything near ECR!
-Yes, sir.

436
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,083
Tell the control room to double
the security at all the exit points!

437
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,041
-No lapses, okay?
-Yes, sir.

438
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,291
-Come on! Double up!
-Yes, sir.

439
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,666
Sir, we are from the TASC Force.

440
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,208
Have you seen this person?

441
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,541
No, sir.

442
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:31,708
Are you sure?

443
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:35,541
Sir, daily, lots of vehicles
come to the checkpoint.

444
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,666
How can I remember everyone, sir?

445
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:41,041
It's a matter of national security, sir.

446
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,500
Sir, I'm also a patriot.

447
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,166
I give my life to my country, sir.

448
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,083
What, sir?

449
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,000
I am also a government
servant like you, sir.

450
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,500
Sorry, sir.

451
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,791
-Muthu.
-Yeah?

452
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,583
Ask everyone around here.

453
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:04,708
Sir, come here.

454
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,750
Show this photo to all the truckers…

455
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,000
-and ask.
-Cigarette.

456
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,625
Check if they have seen her, got it?

457
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,958
Ask everyone around
here if they've seen her.

458
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,833
What are you looking for, sir?

459
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:18,541
Muthu.

460
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,583
-What are you looking for, sir?
-No…

461
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,125
there was a truck, and…

462
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,958
we are looking for a truck
and a couple of people.

463
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,083
This one.

464
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,208
Yes, sir. I saw her yesterday.

465
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,125
He claims to have seen her yesterday.

466
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:44,375
-Get up.
-Sir?

467
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,875
-What happened, sir?
-I want to salute you, sir.

468
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,083
-Stand up! Stand up!
-Sir, you are a patriot, sir.

469
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:51,708
-Sir, what happened?
-You give your life to the country, sir!

470
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:52,625
Sir, what?

471
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:55,958
-You give your life to the country?
-Sir, please! Sir!

472
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,416
-Show me the truck!
-Yes, sir!

473
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,583
-Get me the goddamn truck details!
-Yes, sir.

474
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:02,958
-Tear it off!
-Yes, sir! Doing it, sir!

475
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,125
Tear it!

476
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Yeah, Punit!

477
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,750
The truck was last
seen at the Bangalore checkpoint.

478
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,000
Any idea where it could
have possibly gone?

479
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:15,958
Hold on, sir.

480
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:24,791
Sir, five kilometers down the road,
the highway bifurcates into three forks.

481
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,541
They could have gone in
any of those directions.

482
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,250
There are multiple side roads, as well.

483
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,125
-I'm going to check all of those.
-Keep me posted.

484
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,833
-Fuck! Fuck!
-Alerted all units.

485
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,083
Search operations are on.

486
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,500
I have one more option.

487
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,875
What?

488
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,625
You have broken the protocol.

489
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,000
It is an emergency, sir.

490
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:09,625
Raji is going to take off with
her plane any minute now, sir.

491
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,208
And they will need an airstrip, sir.

492
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,083
Airstrip? No, Srikant.

493
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:16,083
The rebel pilots don't need airstrips.

494
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,375
They can take off from any
stretch of road that is long enough.

495
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,750
Sir, their last known location
is the Bangalore excise point.

496
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:28,083
And their target is
the PM's meeting venue.

497
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,666
Bangalore highway excise checkpoint? Okay.

498
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,625
Is there any open space nearby?

499
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,333
A cricket ground or a football field?

500
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,125
One of Bhaskaran's close friends owned
a property somewhere on that road.

501
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,750
Kicha Farms.

502
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,041
Kicha… Kicha Farms?

503
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,541
Yes, it belongs to Krishnan Ramaswamy.

504
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:49,875
He used to help Bhaskaran, when they
were fighting for the Tamil cause.

505
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:53,458
I feel it's our best shot, given
the geography. You could try that place.

506
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:04,416
Brother Selva!

507
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,000
The plane is ready.

508
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,666
No missing parts?

509
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,833
It's all accounted for, but
we should do a test run.

510
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:11,916
We cannot.

511
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,666
It is a risk we have to take.

512
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,416
We are heading towards Kicha Farms.

513
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,208
There's a possibility
that the plane is there.

514
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:23,375
Send a backup team.
We'll be there any minute.

515
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,250
I'll call you as soon
as I have visual confirmation.

516
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,208
Copy.

517
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,333
Madam, the Sri Lankan President
has arrived at the venue.

518
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:34,125
The meeting should
commence in ten minutes.

519
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:35,500
I'll be there soon.

520
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:13,041
Raji, it is time.

521
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,500
You will be flying blind.

522
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,958
I will guide you as best as I can.

523
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,500
You'll take about 12 minutes
to reach the target.

524
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:29,625
The meeting will last two hours.

525
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,875
Fly low.

526
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,958
I got this, brother.

527
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,875
Martyrs never die.

528
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:47,333
Karthik!

529
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:48,833
Karthik!

530
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,000
-They are here!
-Who?

531
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,458
Fast! Get the explosives!

532
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:01,375
They are here! Take the guns!

533
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,125
Be alert.

534
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,666
Keep looking everywhere.

535
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:32,875
Be careful, guys.

536
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:33,791
Yes, sir.

537
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:03,541
Back off!

538
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,041
Come on! Come on!

539
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:27,583
Shoot! Shoot!

540
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,458
Cover! Cover!

541
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,166
Raji is getting away! Stop her!

542
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:18,958
Hey, Muthu!

543
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:22,541
Muthu, she's heading towards the plane!
Get the car!

544
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:23,875
Get the car!

545
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:29,958
Come! Come soon!

546
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,083
Fast! Move!

547
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,458
Get in.

548
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:41,833
Fast! Fast! Fast!

549
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:43,375
Fast!

550
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,625
Come on!

551
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,250
Fast!

552
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,291
Faster, man!

553
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:54,666
Fast!

554
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,000
Keep the gap.

555
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,083
Keep the gap!

556
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,166
Bring the car near the plane!

557
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,416
Hey, bring it closer!

558
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,708
Get the car! Get the car in the line!

559
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,583
Get the car in the line of the plane!

560
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:11,500
Get the car in the line of the plane!
Come on!

561
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:13,375
Quick! Get closer!

562
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,083
Shoot it down.

563
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:49,000
Fast!

564
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,166
Go, go, go! Faster!

565
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:53,666
Fast!

566
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:09,375
Shoot!

567
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,166
Overtake it!

568
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,916
Block the plane! Overtake it!

569
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:27,916
Stop! Turn the car!

570
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,250
Stop!

571
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,041
This medal is posthumously
awarded to Mr. Milind Hinduja.

572
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,791
Mr. Jayavant Kasinath Talpade.

573
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:47,041
-Thank you for your service to the nation.
-Thank you, ma'am.

574
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,250
I am honored, ma'am.

575
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:55,791
Thank you.

576
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:57,875
Mr. Srikant Tiwari.

577
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,625
I am grateful for what you have done.

578
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,625
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be alive.

579
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,625
I will always be thankful to you.

580
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,250
It is my duty, ma'am.

581
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,791
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

582
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:13,541
Sure.

583
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,166
Thank you, ma'am.

584
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,875
Thank you, ma'am.

585
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:27,041
Mr. Punit Banerjee.

586
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:33,416
Sir, the PM asked if she
could do anything for me.

587
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:37,166
Shall I talk to her about
an interest-free home loan?

588
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,083
No!

589
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:39,583
Mr. Muthu Pandian.

590
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:40,833
Not at all, Srikant.

591
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:47,625
How much is yours for?

592
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,166
The reward is one lakh.

593
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:55,791
Same here. After the ten percent
TDS deduction, that's 90,000.

594
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,583
You were so close to becoming
a mini-millionaire.

595
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,708
Sir, medal please.

596
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,958
-We have to return this?
-Yes, sir.

597
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,166
-Please.
-Yeah, alright.

598
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,125
Thank you.

599
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:13,166
Why do we have to give it back?

600
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:15,291
You'll get it after your retirement.

601
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:18,375
Both, the medal and the photo.

602
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:22,041
Until then, we stay undercover
and so do our medals.

603
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,666
Great.

604
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,291
And then, I was introduced to everyone.

605
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:32,125
And then, she said, "Mr. Srikant Tiwari…

606
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:36,083
I am grateful for what you have done.

607
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,625
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be alive."

608
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:41,375
What is "abhaari"?

609
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:45,375
Why don't you learn some
Hindi along with English?

610
00:53:45,458 --> 00:53:46,541
It'll come in handy!

611
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:49,291
"Abhaari" means gratitude, grateful.

612
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,333
Okay.

613
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:56,208
You know, and then,
she said, "Srikant Tiwari.

614
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,500
Tell me what the country can do for you."

615
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:00,500
And?

616
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:04,416
And what?

617
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,375
Not every question has
an answer, my child.

618
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,500
You hear a compliment like
that and feel good about it.

619
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:10,125
You didn't even take a selfie, Dad.

620
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:11,625
I just--

621
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:14,583
-Did you speak to the school principal?
-What?

622
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,083
To discuss when you'll
be going back to school.

623
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,458
Oh, yes. I'll call her tomorrow.

624
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,333
-Very good.
-I know what you're all up to.

625
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,208
You guys were discussing something else,

626
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:24,625
and when I entered,
you changed the subject.

627
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,333
Nobody changed the subject.

628
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:28,375
Even at the hospital,
you were speaking in code.

629
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,125
Nobody tells me anything!

630
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:32,500
I also know that she
didn't have an accident.

631
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:33,666
It was something else.

632
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,708
I'm not a kid anymore.

633
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,416
He's not a kid anymore!

634
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay. Sorry, son.

635
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:42,375
Please finish your ice cream.
Then, I will hypnotize you!

636
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,250
Hypnosis doesn't work anymore.

637
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,125
Should I try some magic tricks?

638
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,625
Please spare me.

639
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,208
I'm already tired of this hypnosis stuff.

640
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:52,000
Now, please don't start
a new loop with magic tricks.

641
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:06,125
At your birthday dinner,
you started a conversation…

642
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:10,666
but never finished it.

643
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,416
How have you been?

644
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:24,916
Fine.

645
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:29,166
Suchi.

646
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:33,791
What's bothering you?

647
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,833
Sri…

648
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,125
I…

649
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,041
There's something I have
been wanting to tell you.
