1
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,290
Jebaraj?

2
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,660
Bringing him back would
have been fatal for the mission.

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,500
But the C4 detonators were with him!

4
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,040
It must be at his house.

5
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,870
Let us load up and leave.

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,540
Hurry!

7
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,290
This sambar is really good!

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,950
Let me tell you!

9
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,450
My wife, Suchi,
makes better sambar than this.

10
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,450
You understand the true value of
homemade sambar only when you step out.

11
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,000
Asshole!

12
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,410
Try this podi.

13
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,120
-I love--
-Idli podi.

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,250
Idli podi? How does one eat this?

15
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,500
Put it on your plate.
Make a hole in the middle.

16
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,330
Put some ghee.

17
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,950
And mix it up.

18
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,120
Guys! Please,
don't go out without your weapons.

19
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,950
And make sure you are
never alone when you are out.

20
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,910
How is it possible that an entire region
supports a terrorist organization?

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,750
For them, these people aren't terrorists.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,410
They are freedom fighters.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Right!

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,290
Across the globe, the role of
terrorists and revolutionaries…

25
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,200
gets redefined from time to time.

26
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,910
The ruling governments
determine the policy.

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,950
I can see how these people are
heroes, from their point of view.

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,160
If that's how you feel, why
are you hunting them down?

29
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,330
Doesn't matter what I feel.

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,830
I just do my duty.

31
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,830
Exactly.

32
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,700
If you shut up and do your
duty, you'll win a medal.

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,290
But if you want to express your
opinion, you can go to hell.

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,540
Well said, sir.

35
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,120
Srikant, you are late.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,830
-Mr. Chellam--
-Continue washing your hands!

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,200
Late for what, sir?

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,370
Bhaskaran is trying to find
something for his mission.

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,700
If you want to stop him,
you will have to find his team.

40
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,540
But we have no clue who all
are there in Raji's team.

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,290
Selvarasan. He was Raji's handler.

42
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,750
If he's on a mission,
he will be there with her.

43
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,290
What have you found out over here?

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,120
We have been questioning
all the locals here.

45
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,700
We have managed to get a lead, "Local 52."

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,830
Do you know anything about it?

47
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,370
You are questioning the old dogs.

48
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,870
They know nothing.

49
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,700
Local 52 is a smuggler in Veeraranyam.

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,580
Jebaraj.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,620
You will find him at this address.

52
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,410
And stop wasting water!

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,540
JK!

54
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,870
-Hi, ma'am!
-Hi, Gunjan.

55
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,040
You must be Atharv?

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,290
-Hi, I am Gunjan.
-Hello.

57
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,700
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,450
-Welcome.
-Come.

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,000
-Oh! Hi, Suchi!
-Hi!

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,000
Hi, Atharv!

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,540
So, he works here?

62
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,040
Say hi.

63
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,290
You're looking very smart! Where's Dhriti?

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,080
Rhea! Come here!

65
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,540
You remember Auntie Suchi?

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,120
Hi, Rhea! How are you?

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
Do you remember me?

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,290
How could she not!

69
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,910
Ever since you made rasam and rice
for her, she's been after my life!

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,830
You made rasam and rice for her?

71
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,080
-Yes.
-When?

72
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,700
What does it matter?

73
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,750
-Rhea, this is Brother Atharv--
-Mom, don't bro-zone me.

74
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,660
Hi! I am Atharv.

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,120
Mom is coming from America.

76
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,250
Ananya is visiting us from the US.

77
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,290
She wanted to spend some time with Rhea.

78
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,200
That's nice.

79
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,500
You know, I am an expert at hypnosis.

80
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,120
I can hypnotize anyone! Want to try?

81
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,290
-Hi, guys!
-Hi, Nikhil!

82
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,660
-Who is this princess?
-Who is this!

83
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,160
-Hi!
-Hello!

84
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,580
Go, play.

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,620
So, this cool dude is your son?

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
Hi, I am Nikhil.

87
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,500
-Hi, Nikhil. I am Atharv.
-Hey! Address him properly.

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,250
-Hi, Uncle Nikhil. I'm Atharv.
-It's all right.

89
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,790
Mom, can I take Rhea?
I want to hypnotize her.

90
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,830
-I'll be with them.
-Come, Rhea!

91
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,750
Thanks.

92
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,540
He's a charmer! Ladies' man!

93
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,370
He's obsessed with hypnosis, nowadays.

94
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,000
Who knows from where
they learn these things!

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,950
-Nikhil, I need to ask you something.
-Yes, tell me.

96
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,080
You know the client meeting in London?

97
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,870
Do you really need me there?
Can I skip it?

98
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,750
No, no, no!
Yes, of course, I need you there!

99
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,540
There is no meeting without you, Suchi.

100
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,910
-But--
-Please, make it happen.

101
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,950
Please. You have to go.

102
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,540
-Yeah?
-Okay.

103
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,540
Thank you.

104
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,620
Jebaraj's house is down the lane.

105
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,620
We will wait here. You go inside.

106
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,620
What about his wife?

107
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,120
You know what to do.

108
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,370
Raji!

109
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,410
Noise.

110
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,750
Ask her what they were doing there!

111
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,080
You will have to translate in Tamil.

112
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,660
We are saying this for your own good.

113
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,580
Don't hide it,
just tell us whatever you know.

114
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,370
He left home last night.
He hasn't come back since.

115
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,200
-Did you call him?
-He hasn't called! God knows where he is!

116
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,540
Hey!

117
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,250
Catch her!

118
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,410
Get her quickly!

119
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,000
JK! JK!

120
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,870
JK! Stop her!

121
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,290
Selva! They're all over the place!

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,910
Who?

123
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,250
Intelligence!

124
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,910
-We have to cover for Raji!
-Wait!

125
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,450
We have to get this truck out of here!
That is extremely important!

126
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,080
But we can't leave Raji alone.

127
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,540
Sajid, Raji does not need us. Let us go!

128
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,540
Damn it!

129
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,120
-Umayal! Did you see her?
-No!

130
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,040
Follow me! Follow me!

131
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,950
Let's go--

132
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,910
What the hell!

133
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,290
Stop!

134
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,750
Hey, you fool!

135
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,830
Hey, stop!

136
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,790
Stop her!

137
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,660
Stop her! Milind, stop her!

138
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,370
Get her!

139
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,200
Get her!

140
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,830
-Hey, stop.
-Don't move.

141
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,620
-Hey!
-Raji, stop!

142
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,000
I didn't do anything.

143
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,620
-I didn't do anything.
-Don't move!

144
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,950
It is all because of Nanda.

145
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,830
-Hey, stop acting!
-I did nothing!

146
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,870
Hey!

147
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,080
-Hey, Muthu! What is she saying?
-I did nothing.

148
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,410
-Hey, stop!
-I did nothing.

149
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,700
-JK, be careful.
-Don't move!

150
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,750
-Don't move!
-Stop!

151
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,580
JK, step back! What are you doing?

152
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,790
What the hell is she saying?

153
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,950
No!

154
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
JK! Be careful!

155
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,500
Don't do it!

156
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,000
Hey! JK!

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,950
-JK! Be careful!
-Raji!

158
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,870
-JK!
-Raji! Don't do this!

159
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,160
-JK!
-Tiwari!

160
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,540
JK!

161
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,450
Raji!

162
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,040
Don't shoot!

163
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,870
Don't shoot, man! I want her alive!

164
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,370
Go into the lane ahead! Hurry!

165
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,160
-JK! Get up!
-Are you okay?

166
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,040
What? Yes, I'm okay!
Are you okay? Do you need help?

167
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,330
Do you need help?

168
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,000
Die, man!

169
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,700
Hey, catch her!

170
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,500
Put her down!

171
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,200
Put her down!

172
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't let her get away!

173
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,450
Hold on to her!

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,330
Srikant, there has been an incident
in Sri Lanka at Point Pedro.

175
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,870
Last night, some infiltrators
went there from Veeraranyam.

176
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,830
This used to be an old smuggling route…

177
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,250
and intel suggests that
they smuggled arms.

178
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,080
Sir, I was just about to call you.

179
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
This is all a part of
Bhaskaran's plan, sir.

180
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,580
But we may have a breakthrough now.

181
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,540
Raji is in our custody.

182
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
Good work, Srikant.

183
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,870
We have to break Raji.

184
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,330
You didn't have to do this, Arvind.

185
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,660
We could have taken an Uber.

186
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,450
It's no big deal.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,620
-Is Dhriti at home?
-She's with her boyfriend!

188
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,540
Atharv! Enough!

189
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
She's at home.

190
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,660
You should have brought her along.

191
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,700
I think she would've had fun.

192
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,370
She thinks she's too cool for all this.

193
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,950
-Bye, I'll see you.
-When?

194
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,370
-Tomorrow. At four.
-I will call you.

195
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,910
-Text me!
-I will text you.

196
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,160
Thank you, Arvind.

197
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,700
-What happened?
-Nothing.

198
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,870
Bye!

199
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,250
I need some more.

200
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,410
Bloody hell!

201
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,750
Muthu, please?

202
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,410
Please.

203
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,160
I have called for backup.
They will be here in three hours.

204
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,000
We are only a skeletal
crew at this station.

205
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,200
Madam.

206
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,410
You should all leave before the locals
learn about the rebels' situation.

207
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,540
That's the spot.

208
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,910
You will leave, right?

209
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,830
-Okay, Shekhar.
-Thank you.

210
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,500
Sir, there's a problem--

211
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,870
Understood.

212
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,160
Muthu, you and JK go to Jebaraj's house…

213
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,500
and try to get some
information out of his wife.

214
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,000
Tiwari, can we go after ten minutes?

215
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,200
Muthu, let us go.

216
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,080
Wait! I will go.

217
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,750
Let's talk to Raji.

218
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,750
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,620
Where are the rest of your friends?

220
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,040
Friend? Where?

221
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
I know you aren't working alone.

222
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,620
We also know about Local 52.

223
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,290
Jebaraj? Point Pedro mission?

224
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,500
We know everything about it.

225
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,750
What did you bring back from there?

226
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,660
What is your plan?

227
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
You have been lying to me
ever since we met!

228
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't you use the rape card!

229
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,950
Shut up and answer his questions!

230
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,830
Raji, we recognize all your friends.

231
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
I know you have been brainwashed.

232
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,200
Just tell us about their whereabouts.

233
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,620
Look.

234
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,200
You just have to help us.

235
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,830
Give us their info.

236
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,120
Then, Europe or Canada…

237
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,700
wherever you'd like to relocate…

238
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,830
I will help you with it.

239
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,000
I will arrange everything.

240
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,450
Their chief,
he's hiding somewhere in London.

241
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,250
And he is getting all the dangerous
work done by these young people.

242
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,910
What sort of a leader is he! Your chief!

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,950
Don't you dare utter my chief's name!

244
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,250
Just answer the questions! Got it?

245
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,700
If you want to live…

246
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,830
then let me go.

247
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,830
-Stop! Enough!
-She is threatening us, sir!

248
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,830
Enough, enough, enough, Umayal.

249
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,700
This happened eight years ago…

250
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,200
on my wedding anniversary.

251
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,750
My wife…

252
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,160
my daughter…

253
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,450
my little one-year-old son, Vaibhav…

254
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,580
and I… we all went out for dinner.

255
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,330
We were chatting, laughing, and giggling.

256
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,700
Suddenly, a few armed
strangers entered the place.

257
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,040
They looked even younger than you.

258
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,000
They opened fire at people.

259
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,700
Men, women, young, old,
all innocent people…

260
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,830
they didn't spare anyone.

261
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,620
I did whatever I could to try
and get my family out of there.

262
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,000
And then, I started feeling…

263
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,700
the weight in my hands.

264
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,290
I looked down.

265
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,160
It was…

266
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,660
And that day, I decided…

267
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,870
that I will never let
another innocent person die.

268
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,330
I truly believe…

269
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,160
that there is still some
humanity left in you, Raji.

270
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,000
It is there.

271
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,790
And I know it.

272
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,410
My father was a school teacher.

273
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,500
That day, he'd got us new textbooks.

274
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,950
He went to the school to distribute them.

275
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,410
The Lankan Army made
an airstrike on the school…

276
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,250
and my father's dead
body was not even found.

277
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,290
When I was only 15 years old…

278
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,790
the Lankan Army shot down
my brother and his friends.

279
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,830
He was only nine.

280
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,870
After that…

281
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,620
they took me to their base and there…

282
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,540
one after another…

283
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,620
There were so many of them… I lost count.

284
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,830
Then, the Chief…

285
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,040
saved my life.

286
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,950
And my story is real.

287
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,000
Do whatever you want.

288
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,620
Torture me, pour acid over my
body, rape me.

289
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,080
You wouldn't get a word out.

290
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,450
-Bloody dogs!
-Sir, please!

291
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,870
Please, please.

292
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,950
Sir, were you able to get
anything out of her?

293
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,200
Milind, when a man turns into an animal…

294
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,290
he starts behaving worse than them.

295
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,950
And if you mix it with politics…

296
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,620
then, he turns into a monster.

297
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,750
Sometimes, I think,
do we really make a difference?

298
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,830
I am sure we do, sir.

299
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,370
Do we?

300
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,540
At least, I hope so.

301
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,540
Any news?

302
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,870
Jebaraj's wife is worried sick.

303
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,700
He hasn't returned home.

304
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,290
She said that yesterday, he went out
somewhere with three other people.

305
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,870
Raji, some guy from up north,
and the third one was Selvarasan.

306
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,000
She identified him from a photograph.

307
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,910
Did Raji give any information?

308
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,500
She is not going to tell us anything.

309
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,250
Check with people in the nearby villages.

310
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,790
Maybe, someone has seen
Selvarasan or Jebaraj.

311
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,450
We will start with Adhanur?

312
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,080
-Let's go then.
-Okay.

313
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,660
This is going out of control, Sambit!

314
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,080
Major Sameer is hand-in-glove with
Bhaskaran, and Bhaskaran has vanished.

315
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
And we have dead Sri Lankan soldiers.

316
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,160
Our agencies are unable to figure out
what was taken from Point Pedro.

317
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,830
And this is because of you!

318
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,790
It's not the time for blame
games, Kulkarni.

319
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,750
Our Prime Minister had a point to prove…

320
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,830
and you have added fuel to the fire.

321
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,410
Now, when that fire has reached
your doorstep, you blame us!

322
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,950
If I start keeping a count
of political fiascoes,

323
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,410
then we will all be in deep shit.

324
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,750
But the difference here is that
whatever I do, I do it for the nation!

325
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,500
Not because I have aspirations
of becoming the Defense Minister!

326
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,120
Our only hope is that…

327
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,910
Srikant gets Raji to talk, soon!

328
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,250
Brother, have you seen Jebaraj?

329
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,620
No?

330
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,040
Brother, have you seen
Jebaraj anywhere around here?

331
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,950
He is a big man.
He doesn't come to shops like ours.

332
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,330
Okay.

333
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,080
Have you seen him around?

334
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,870
No, sir.

335
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,620
Look at him properly.

336
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,120
Hey, that's my house! No one is at home!

337
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,200
Hello, Chief.

338
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,330
-Did anyone follow you?
-No, Chief.

339
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,540
This is an important mission, got it?

340
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,660
Yes, Chief.

341
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,000
Our leader is supervising this.

342
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,910
-When do we start?
-Now.

343
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,370
We have to get going before the
police backup arrives from Trichy.

344
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,620
We were wondering if you've seen
a man named Jebaraj around here.

345
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,410
Check the local bar,
you'll find him there.

346
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Have you seen this man?

347
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,290
No.

348
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,250
Are you sure?

349
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,080
Brother!

350
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,950
You should leave. Your life is in danger.

351
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,370
Sir!

352
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,660
A few local people support rebels, sir.

353
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,040
One MLA's people are spreading lies.

354
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,620
They're saying that
the police killed Jebaraj.

355
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,950
And that there are North Indian
people at the police station, sir.

356
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,200
Yes, I am getting reports
of movement in the village.

357
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,450
Sir, we can't stay here for long.

358
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,450
As soon as the backup comes,
we all leave from here.

359
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,370
Where are they?

360
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,750
-Two hours, sir. There is some delay.
-Two hours!

361
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,120
I will check again, sir.

362
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,080
Sir, let's try to interrogate her!

363
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,040
Let's try to get the truth out of her.

364
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,080
She's a highly trained guerrilla, Milind.

365
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,250
She won't say a thing
without Sodium Pentothal.

366
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,950
We'll have to take her
to Chennai and then see.

367
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,290
Why are they staring at us?

368
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,910
Obviously, we are not welcome here.

369
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,750
Why are people allergic
to us wherever we go!

370
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,450
Just don't make eye contact. Just walk.

371
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,580
Motherfucker! They flattened the tires!

372
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,040
Keep walking.

373
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,540
Milind! Umayal! Call JK and Muthu,
and ask them to return immediately!

374
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,120
Get all the constables inside!
Lock down the entire police station!

375
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,290
Sir, what's happening?

376
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,910
I think, we are under attack.

377
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,290
Don't shoot! Hold the fire!

378
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,660
Don't shoot till I order!

379
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,870
Shekhar! Go down and check!

380
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,700
Sir.

381
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,290
Stay there.

382
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,790
Cover me! Cover me!

383
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,660
Are you okay?

384
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,330
Sir, man down! Sir!

385
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,370
Officer down! Officer down!

386
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,540
Get away from the window!

387
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,080
Get away from the window!

388
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,540
Step away from the window! Step away!

389
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,450
Fuck!

390
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,870
Go! Get Raji!

391
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,950
Get Raji here!

392
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,700
Hey! Raji!

393
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,620
Untie me if you're a man!

394
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,620
I have no interest in
proving that I am a man!

395
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,580
Move it!

396
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,290
Hey, Sajid! Back off!

397
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,330
Back off!

398
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,410
Put down your weapon!

399
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,410
Put it down!

400
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,410
Or I will kill her!

401
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,450
Put it down!

402
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,250
Get Raji and run!

403
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,580
Hurry up!

404
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,870
Milind?

405
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,790
Milind?

406
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,080
Oh, shit!

407
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,250
Milind?

408
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,750
Milind!

409
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,290
Milind! Open your eyes!
Come on! Open them!

410
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,250
Milind!

411
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,370
Open your eyes!

412
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,080
Milind!

413
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,950
Shit!

414
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,790
Raji, are you okay?

415
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,120
I will live.

416
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,080
The bullet went through.

417
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,950
We will regroup at Tigris in Chennai.

418
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,200
Take care of Raji.

419
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,370
Get to Tigris quickly.

420
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,250
Fuck!

421
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,830
That motherfucker Srikant
is always getting into way!

422
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,120
Make way, make way!

423
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,250
Come!

424
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,580
Make it fast!

425
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,790
Bring from this side.

426
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,870
Come soon, come soon.

427
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,870
Move aside.

428
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,830
Sri?

429
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,330
Sri, where are you?

430
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,500
Sri, what happened?

431
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,790
Nothing, I will call you later.

432
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,870
-Yes, Sajid?
-Greetings, brother.

433
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,500
Greetings. Tell me, what is it?

434
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,160
Raji is back with us!

435
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
But there is one problem.

436
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,910
What?

437
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,540
Srikant Tiwari!

438
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,500
That fucking infidel!

439
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,660
He has been a pain in the ass!

440
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,660
Don't worry.

441
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,830
I have a plan…

442
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,910
that will take care of him.

443
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,790
You just give me permission.

444
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,410
And I will take care of him forever.

445
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,870
Activate it, immediately.

446
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,200
Hello?

447
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,160
Salman?

448
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,540
Yes, brother. Greetings.

449
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,540
Greetings.

450
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,410
Do you still talk to that girl?

451
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,660
Dhriti? No. Not at all.

452
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,040
I haven't spoken to her ever
since you asked me to stop.

453
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,620
Brother, he's lying!

454
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,540
He has a romance brewing with her!

455
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,540
Give him the phone!

456
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,160
Try fucking around now!

457
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,290
Talk to him.

458
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,540
-Brother, I--
-Salman!

459
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,120
Do you want to carry out the mission?
Yes or no?

460
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,290
Should I kick you out right now?

461
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,450
Have you forgotten what they
did to your parents?

462
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,250
I haven't.

463
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,830
I will carry out the mission.

464
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,370
I made a mistake. Forgive me.

465
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,580
This is your last chance.

466
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,000
There is a change in plan.

467
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,250
We need that girl in our
possession by tomorrow.

468
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,370
Will you be able to do it?

469
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,750
-Consider it done, brother.
-Now, hang up.
