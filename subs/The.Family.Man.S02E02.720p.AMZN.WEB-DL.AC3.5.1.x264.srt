1
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,040
Done?

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,250
I am running a maintenance patch.

3
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,830
All the CCTV cameras will
be offline for ten minutes.

4
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,700
Salaam alaikum, Mr. Ansari.

5
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,250
Seems like it's God's will…

6
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,580
that London's air suits you.

7
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,500
Tell your men to back down.

8
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,250
I have just come by…

9
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,160
to say hello.

10
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,370
Major Sameer!

11
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,250
They let you out of prison!

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,700
Congrats!

13
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,790
Listen, Sameer.

14
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,290
I know what you're thinking.

15
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,040
Believe me, there was no other way.

16
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,660
I am sorry.

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,910
Is that all the faith you had in me?

18
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,330
General!

19
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,660
If Mission Zulfiqar had succeeded--

20
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,910
Yes, but it didn't, Sameer.

21
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,870
I heard you had a Plan B in place,
which succeeded?

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,450
Why, Sameer?

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,870
You bought into the stories…
we tell our recruits?

24
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,120
What did you achieve with Plan B?

25
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,750
Absolutely nothing.

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,950
Plan A was superior.

27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,700
A nerve gas attack…

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,660
could have triggered a war.

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,200
But that did not happen.

30
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,040
Because you betrayed us.

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,830
Plan B was also meant
to be smaller in scale.

32
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,040
And by the grace of Allah,
it was a success.

33
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,580
It's unfortunate that
the Indian government

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,410
projected it as an accident
and changed the narrative.

35
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,830
General!

36
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,200
If you hadn't betrayed us for this
sacrilegious life in London,

37
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,040
things would have been so different today.

38
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,830
I had no other option, Sameer.

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,200
The Prime Minister had already
cut a deal with the Indians.

40
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,370
What would you have done
had you been in my place?

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,200
There's no point in clinging
to the past, Mr. Ansari.

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,870
Let us look at the future.

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,540
I have a new plan.

44
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,540
Zulfiqar 2.0.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,370
I may need your help.

46
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,120
Of course!

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,370
Do call me, whenever you need anything.

48
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,830
God willing!

49
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,620
Goodbye, Mr. Ansari.

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,410
What happened? Help him!

51
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,790
Oh, my God!

52
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,450
We need to make the delivery to
the customer in a couple of days.

53
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,910
Are we on track, Raji?

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,000
I think, something is stuck here.

55
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,700
What soap do you use?

56
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,200
You smell really good.

57
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,540
Raji, you don't wear
your hair up these days.

58
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,950
It is about safety.

59
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,540
I don't want your hair to get
caught in the machine, you know.

60
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,040
It isn't a rule or anything.

61
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,410
I am just looking out for you, that's all.

62
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,080
Nanda!

63
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,120
-Hello, Mr. Kothari!
-I was looking for you.

64
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,040
-Can we meet now?
-Yes, I'll come.

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,870
Raji…

66
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,580
you look really good when you
tie your hair up in a bun.

67
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,250
Get down fast if this is your stop.

68
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,080
Hurry up and please, make way!

69
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,160
"Your present circumstances
don't determine where you can go.

70
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,750
They merely determine where you start."

71
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,660
Dad, what does this mean?

72
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,790
Your present…

73
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,370
circumstances don't determine…

74
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,580
where you can go.

75
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They merely determine…

76
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,660
where you start.

77
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,330
Even I can do this 50-50 translation.

78
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,160
Why did you bring him along?

79
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,580
He had so many classes.

80
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,040
I didn't get a chance to drop him home.

81
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,200
How's Arvind doing?

82
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,540
I don't know.

83
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,540
Must be fine.

84
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,450
Aren't you guys in touch?

85
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,910
Suchi!

86
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,540
What is the need to bring in a third
person to solve problems in our marriage?

87
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,870
This isn't a goddamn disease!

88
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,540
Yes, sir?

89
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,700
We can sort this out ourselves.

90
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,370
Do you want to add anything to this?

91
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,620
Me?

92
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,830
Excuse me?

93
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,080
-Have you filled the form?
-Don't need this.

94
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,040
Yes.

95
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,540
Sir, may I have the form?

96
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,750
Sir, we give this book to all the couples.

97
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,330
Only to those who need it, I am sure?

98
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,160
No, sir. We give it to everyone.

99
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,250
Sir, you get a free relaxation
audio file with the book.

100
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,790
The doctor recommends you read
this book before your next appointment.

101
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,330
Is it free?

102
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,580
It's complimentary…

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,370
with a 25% discount.

104
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,870
Complimentary or discounted?

105
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,750
So, Suchitra…

106
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,950
you didn't want your husband to be
working in a dangerous environment.

107
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,200
You wanted him to do a conventional job.

108
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,830
But as soon as Srikant found himself
a corporate job, you quit your job.

109
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,870
That's because I wanted to
spend more time with the kids.

110
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,540
And you, Srikant.

111
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,830
Switching jobs…

112
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,000
must have been tough.

113
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,200
Any trouble adapting to your new life?

114
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,120
Not really.

115
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,660
I adapt very quickly. I am alright.

116
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,450
For the time being,
let us set this discussion aside.

117
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,160
Let us do a simple exercise, okay?

118
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,290
Srikant…

119
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,870
tell me five things…

120
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,620
you are grateful to Suchitra for.

121
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,660
Five things?

122
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,250
I-I mean, why only five?

123
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,200
There are many things which
I really admire about her.

124
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,200
I mean…

125
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,370
like, I am really grateful that…

126
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,790
she never lets the kids feel
my absence in their lives.

127
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,950
And…

128
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,410
and…

129
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,370
she's a very good Bharatanatyam dancer.
She excels at it.

130
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,750
And sambar… she cooks it so well!

131
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,700
And rasam!

132
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,330
Yeah!

133
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,080
Even if you count sambar and rasam,
that's only four things, Sri.

134
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,080
He put me on the spot.

135
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,040
You should've warned me about this
quiz show. I would have come prepared.

136
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,160
Okay, Srikant! Relax!

137
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
Now, your turn.

138
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,080
He's a great dad.

139
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,290
He's a very principled man.

140
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,620
Great sense of humor.

141
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,120
Very intelligent.

142
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,700
He's very committed and hardworking.

143
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,290
And…

144
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,830
he can cook up a lie at the drop of a hat.

145
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,040
Okay, now.

146
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,450
How physically intimate
are you with each other?

147
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,830
As in…

148
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,700
-how often--
-How often what?

149
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,830
I mean to ask how physically
intimate you are in life.

150
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,830
Generally, you know.

151
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,950
Are you asking…

152
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,080
how many times we have sex?

153
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,910
Physical intimacy is just not about sex.

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
It's much more.

155
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,500
It's an indicator of your emotional bond.

156
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,830
Holding hands.

157
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,080
A hug or a kiss before leaving for work.
Cuddling.

158
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,290
These are…

159
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,790
quite personal details!

160
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,200
Srikant, stop looking
at sex as a taboo subject.

161
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,200
You should be able
to talk openly about it.

162
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,500
Is this a joke?

163
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,120
This is so childish!

164
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,330
I'll get better advice than this
from a simple search on my phone.

165
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,290
Mr. Srikant, you can become
knowledgeable from others' knowledge.

166
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,000
But you cannot become
wise from others' wisdom.

167
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,250
You can find this quote on Google!

168
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,870
I never said it was my quote.

169
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,120
Even I know a few quotes.

170
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,700
"If you and I agree on everything,
then one of us is unnecessary,

171
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,000
-for fuck's sake."
-Keep quiet.

172
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,830
"Sometimes, to win, you must lose first,

173
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,580
and he who wins after losing
is called the Gambler."

174
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,120
-What?
-"Beyond fear lies victory."

175
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
"To the victor go the spoils."
"Motherfucker!"

176
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,830
-Suchitra, what is this?
-He's a doctor!

177
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,500
-We are paying for these quotes?
-This is a therapy session!

178
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,870
Fuck it! I am not part of it!

179
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,330
-I am not part of it!
-Srikant!

180
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,450
He's a fraud!

181
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,950
Let us go, Atharv.

182
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,120
He needs serious help.

183
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,830
I promise I'll get another appointment.

184
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,790
Really sorry.

185
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,250
Charge them 3,000.

186
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,450
Actually, wait.

187
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,580
Charge them 5,000.

188
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,620
And they pay for the book.

189
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,370
That's right.

190
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,790
It's safe.

191
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,410
There are no cameras installed here.

192
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,580
You will run this entire operation, Sajid.

193
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,790
I've been waiting to go back to India.

194
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,330
You're going there for
a really honorable mission.

195
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,580
I want your 100% focus on this mission.

196
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,290
We have the opportunity
to attack India once again.

197
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,500
-Let us not waste--
-Brother Sameer, I will do my job.

198
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,620
Stay under the radar.

199
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,000
Complete the mission.

200
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,290
And get out!

201
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,580
No personal work.

202
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,450
Yes.

203
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,790
And don't do anything…

204
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,450
that I wouldn't approve of.

205
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,870
Passport and ticket.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,500
Your flight leaves in six hours.

207
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,290
God be with you.

208
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,450
Goodbye.

209
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,790
Goodbye.

210
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,540
Hello?

211
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,540
Hello, Mr. Sambit.

212
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,080
I am Deepan from London.

213
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,250
I hope you remember me.

214
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,330
Oh! Hi, Deepan.

215
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,250
I think, you have…

216
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,620
Subbu in your custody.

217
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,200
He's the Foreign Minister
of our government.

218
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,500
Government in Exile.

219
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,790
You technically are not a government.

220
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,750
No, no, no!

221
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,950
Even the UK and France are close
to offering us support at this time.

222
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,120
What do you want from me, Deepan?

223
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,000
We want Subbu back.

224
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,370
He killed Indian officers.

225
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,620
He has to go through the due process
according to the law of the land.

226
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,330
Are you going to gift
Subbu to the Lankans?

227
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,910
That's ridiculous.

228
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,450
I am sure we can work something out.

229
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
You are not bound by international laws.

230
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,290
Please!

231
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,660
Don't hand him over to the Lankans.

232
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,450
I'll see what I can do, Deepan.
I can't promise you anything.

233
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,790
Mr. Sambit,
I'd like to tell you one thing.

234
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,000
If something happens to Subbu…

235
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,540
there will be repercussions,
and it'll be beyond my control.

236
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,450
Are you threatening me?

237
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,870
No, no, no.

238
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,370
I am not threatening you.
I am just asking for your help.

239
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,250
I don't want my movement
to be derailed again.

240
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,450
Like I said…

241
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,620
I'll see whatever I can do.

242
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
But you must tell Bhaskaran…

243
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,250
that his brother crossed
the limits this time.

244
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,290
And Deepan, keep your movement
in mind before you do anything.

245
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,330
You don't want to put us in a position
where we have to extend

246
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,660
the ban on your organization indefinitely.

247
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,290
You don't want to do that…

248
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,870
right?

249
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,620
Bhaskaran.

250
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,830
Bad news?

251
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,580
I wish I could say no.

252
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,950
India will use Subbu to score
brownie points with Sri Lanka.

253
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,370
Not necessarily. I spoke to Sambit.
Let us wait and see.

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,910
If I were the man I was ten years ago--

255
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,250
The Government of France…

256
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,700
is about to lift the ban on us.

257
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,290
We need to be coolheaded about this.

258
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,450
What do you want me to do?

259
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,450
The Lankans will kill Subbu for sure.

260
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,290
We could have done something
if only Subbu had not tried to escape.

261
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,450
You are the one who sent him to India.

262
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,500
We!

263
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,450
We sent him!

264
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,120
Deepan!

265
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,870
I don't care what you do.

266
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,580
I want Subbu back in London.

267
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,870
Hi!

268
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,000
Hi!

269
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,660
Since when have you been waiting here?

270
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,750
About an hour.

271
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,870
You are mad!

272
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,790
About you?

273
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,790
Yes!

274
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,910
Now don't do this stupid, filmy shit.

275
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,120
How was school?

276
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,830
Don't ask.

277
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,790
Hey, dude!

278
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,000
Aren't you going home?

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,540
If Mom calls, just tell her
I am studying with you,

280
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,290
and can't talk because I am in the loo.

281
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,120
Kalyan, Mahima. Mahima, Kalyan.

282
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
Hi.

283
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,410
Where are you taking me?

284
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,580
It's a surprise.

285
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,410
What are we doing here?

286
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,410
Seriously, where are we going?

287
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,910
Come.

288
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,250
Trust me.

289
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,580
Come.

290
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,120
Come.

291
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,660
Okay, Dhriti!

292
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,500
Close your eyes.

293
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,450
What?

294
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,000
You said you trust me…

295
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,950
right?

296
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Close your eyes.

297
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,200
Okay.

298
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,580
Great!

299
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,580
Come.

300
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,620
Left.

301
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,830
-Where?
-Take it easy.

302
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,330
Kalyan, I am really scared, okay?

303
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,410
Don't be scared.

304
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
I'll open?

305
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,040
Wait.

306
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,790
-What the fuck!
-Calm down!

307
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,700
-Let me go, please!
-Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen.

308
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,830
I am not gonna let you fall.

309
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,660
Just open your eyes…

310
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,750
and see the view.

311
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,450
This is a view?

312
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,410
Are you new in Mumbai?

313
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,910
Okay, my bad.

314
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,120
Have you ever broken a rule?

315
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,620
Yes.

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,910
Yeah? When?

317
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
When I…

318
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,370
I don't think so.

319
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,830
Honestly, I don't think
you've ever broken a rule.

320
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,160
You need to be home before dark.

321
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,250
You don't talk to too many boys.

322
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,500
You've obviously never had boyfriends.

323
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,450
How do you know I've
never had a boyfriend?

324
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,410
Well, I can guess that much.

325
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,330
Really?

326
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,580
Really.

327
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,290
Who is it?

328
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,910
Mom. I have to go.

329
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Okay, later.

330
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,660
I will count to ten…

331
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,700
and you will fall asleep.

332
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,700
One.

333
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,620
Two.

334
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,830
-Three.
-Stop playing with my chain!

335
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,870
It will break.

336
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,870
Nobody ever wants to play with me.

337
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,830
Please play with me.

338
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,870
Okay, fine.

339
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,830
-What do I have to do?
-Just lean back a little.

340
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,830
Lean back.

341
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,290
Close your eyes.

342
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,330
Now, you are totally relaxed.

343
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,790
And you are going to do exactly as I say.

344
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,330
This is a really dumb game.

345
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,700
Get lost!

346
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,910
It's all about visualization.

347
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,580
Think about the first
time you touched her.

348
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,700
You stroked her hair.

349
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,620
Papa!

350
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,370
Think of that.

351
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,830
What do you want?

352
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,000
Please play with me.

353
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,750
Playtime is over.

354
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,830
Finish your homework, and go to sleep.

355
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,410
Nobody cares about my future.

356
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,410
Visualize the life entering
your body from the light.

357
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,250
Kattappa!

358
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,870
Before I count to ten…

359
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,790
you will fall asleep!

360
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,080
One.

361
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,870
Two.

362
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,870
Three.

363
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,870
Four.

364
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,370
Five.

365
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,500
Six.

366
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Kattappa fell asleep!

367
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,000
Did you see that?

368
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,200
What?

369
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,450
Kattappa fell asleep!

370
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,540
I didn't see it.

371
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,370
Shit! Did anyone else see that?

372
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,950
No one saw?

373
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,660
You know, I've finished half of that book.

374
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,700
It's really very good.

375
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,040
Very nice.

376
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,700
Good.

377
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,370
JK!

378
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,870
Let's meet in the evening?

379
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,370
Happy birthday to you!

380
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,000
Happy birthday to you!

381
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,700
Happy birthday!

382
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,250
Srikant…

383
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,750
follow me.

384
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,580
You know what? I am 28, right?

385
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,750
And I am the CEO.

386
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,040
How did that happen?

387
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,160
How?

388
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,200
Because I never think small, you know?

389
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,040
I am a team player!

390
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,290
I…

391
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,660
always think about me…

392
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,370
my team…

393
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,410
my company…

394
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,330
my country.

395
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,750
You know?

396
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,910
What more can I do for my country!

397
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,040
For my company!

398
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,200
Not now! Later.

399
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,950
Okay, let us take her for example.

400
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,410
I don't even know her name.

401
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,000
But I will make sure…

402
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,040
that I am present at her
cake-cutting ceremony.

403
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,660
You on the other hand, I…

404
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,580
I never see you at any…

405
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,910
any team-building exercises. Any…

406
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,250
cake-cutting sessions.

407
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,290
Any other activities in the office.

408
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,790
If that is the case, you know, I'll…

409
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,660
I'll enroll myself in
an upcoming workshop, and…

410
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,120
I'll sing at every birthday party…

411
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,040
-"Happy birthday to you!"
-It's not about that, man.

412
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,250
I'll show you something.

413
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,290
Yes!

414
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,330
Read this.

415
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,580
Read what your colleagues,

416
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,580
your younger colleagues
have to say about you.

417
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,500
Go on.

418
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,790
"He belongs in a government office."

419
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,450
"Working with him is like having your…

420
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,750
dad…

421
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,040
as your classmate in college."

422
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,830
"He needs to…

423
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,410
G-A-L."

424
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,450
-What is--
-Get a life, Srikant!

425
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,040
Get a life, man!

426
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,620
We'll do your review,
the next review, after three months.

427
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,200
You know, I give you three months!

428
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,950
And don't forget…

429
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,500
the five golden words motto.

430
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,580
You do know that, right?

431
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,580
Yes, that's the "minimum guy" thing.

432
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,290
"Don't be a minimum guy."

433
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,330
Yeah.

434
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,200
Repeat after me.

435
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,950
Don't…

436
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,870
be a minimum guy!

437
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,000
Hey, come on!
It's good for your heart! Do it!

438
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,160
Don't be a minimum guy!

439
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,540
-Don't be a minimum guy!
-Minimum guy.

440
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,950
-Don't be a minimum guy!
-Minimum guy.

441
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,950
That's good, my boy!

442
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,000
Do it!

443
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,580
Fuck this shit.

444
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,120
Hello, sir!

445
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,290
My name is Unmesh Joshi.

446
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,160
I am a journalist at Navbharat Jyot.

447
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,250
How can I help you?

448
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,290
Sir, a year ago,
this video of a Kashmiri student,

449
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,200
Kareem Bhatt, had leaked online.

450
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,620
He had claimed that our…

451
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,080
security agencies were trying to kill him.

452
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,790
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

453
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,370
Sir! The video was leaked on the internet,

454
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,580
and vanished mysteriously
after a few hours.

455
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,160
Look, what did you say your name was?

456
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,540
-Unmesh Joshi.
-Right, Mr. Joshi,

457
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,410
I work here at this IT firm.

458
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,160
There's been a misunderstanding.

459
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,540
-Now, if you'll excuse me…
-Mr. Srikant Tiwari.

460
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,540
I know that you worked for
the NIA's special unit, TASC.

461
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,000
Sir, I've tried to ask a lot of people,

462
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,750
but nobody wants to talk about it.

463
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,580
I thought, since you've already quit TASC,

464
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,080
maybe, you could tell me something.

465
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,830
Mr. Srikant!

466
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,870
Why did you quit your job at TASC?

467
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,620
Did you quit TASC because
of Kareem Bhatt's death?

468
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,540
I am the press! You can't touch me!

469
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,910
I have no statement to give to you.

470
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,830
For your own sake, stay away from me.

471
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,410
If I see you near me again, I'll bloody--

472
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,580
I am not going to let you get
away with it, Srikant Tiwari!

473
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,620
-Hi, Auntie! How are you?
-Hi, I am doing alright.

474
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,370
Zoya, look who it is!

475
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,830
Hey, Milind!

476
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,450
-Go, see her. I'll get you some tea.
-Yes.

477
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,950
-Sit, sit, sit.
-I am fine, I am fine, I am fine.

478
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,870
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

479
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,700
I just get dizzy…

480
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,950
a little bit, that's it.

481
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,000
-For you.
-Thank you.

482
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,870
Better?

483
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Can I bum a cigarette?

484
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,000
-Have you lost your mind?
-Just give me one, quick!

485
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,120
Mom will be here soon
with the tea. Please!

486
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,500
Why are you doing this?

487
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,000
Take this pack from me later.

488
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,290
So, to what do I owe this surprise?

489
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,410
Mr. Srikant and JK had stopped by.

490
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,790
TASC wants you back?

491
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,580
What did you say?

492
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,290
I haven't made up my mind yet.

493
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,410
If nothing had happened to me…

494
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,000
what would you have said to them?

495
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,370
Milind, I am fine.

496
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,790
I am fine.

497
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,000
Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault.

498
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,000
Don't punish yourself.

499
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,910
-But Zoya, I just--
-Milind, just…

500
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,540
promise me that…

501
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,790
you'll come back safe, okay?

502
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Promise?

503
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,830
Now, go have a chat with my mother.

504
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,450
And keep her distracted.

505
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,700
I need to smoke this in peace.
Otherwise, she'll shout at me again.

506
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,870
-Auntie, do you need any help?
-No, I am fine. Sugar?

507
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,660
Half a teaspoon.

508
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,450
I hope she didn't ask you for a cigarette.

509
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
No, she didn't.

510
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,870
Do stop by whenever you can.
It cheers her up.

511
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,500
Sri!

512
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,000
Who was this journalist?

513
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,450
Unmesh Joshi, sir.

514
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,160
I don't think you need
to worry about this video.

515
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,950
I think it was barely online for an hour,
following which we had it taken down.

516
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,540
If these people try…

517
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,540
to contact you again…

518
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,330
or if they in any way try to…

519
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,040
be in touch with you,
please, make no contact with them.

520
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,370
Look, we'll take care of it.

521
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Sir…

522
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,000
I am just lost.

523
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,200
This guilt is really eating me up.

524
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,370
Everybody wants the truth
to be on their side.

525
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,540
Yet, nobody wants to stand by the truth.

526
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,620
Just think about Kareem's family.

527
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,200
They'll all have to spend the remainder
of their lives with the guilt…

528
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,910
thinking their son was a terrorist.

529
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,330
They deserve to know the truth.

530
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,910
Unfortunately…

531
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,120
that is the price for peace.

532
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,200
It's the way it is, Sri.

533
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,830
You aren't in this alone.

534
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Everyone is guilty.

535
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,660
All of us!

536
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,080
We would reach the court in a couple
of minutes. Inform the judge. Over.

537
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,950
Copy, sir. Our pilot vehicle
has reached the court.

538
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,000
They said the judge will be there
by the time you reach. Over.

539
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,830
The Traffic DC has agreed
to the green channel, sir.

540
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,830
Okay!

541
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,200
Secure the perimeter!

542
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,450
And clear everyone from the area.
Clear, clear, clear!

543
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,200
Bring him.

544
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,160
Clear there.

545
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,870
In the southern Indian city of Chennai,

546
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,370
the opposition leaders have blamed
the administration and Ms. Basu

547
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:56,660
for the death of Mr. Subramaniam
Palanivel also known as Subbu.

548
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,910
The administration, however,

549
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
categorically dismissed
the allegations as baseless.

550
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,330
Many casualties were feared after
an explosion in a Chennai court.

551
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,330
The police are not ruling out that
this could be a terrorist attack.

552
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,700
-Down with police brutality!
-Down with police brutality!

553
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,750
The ISI is involved in Subbu's death?

554
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,250
-We have a report with credible intel--
-This whole thing has become a joke!

555
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,120
We can't pin every
problem we face on the ISI!

556
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,410
Martyr Subbu!
Tamil Eelam deserves justice!

557
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:50,410
Martyrs never die, Chief.

558
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,540
We should start a campaign
on social media, #JusticeforSubbu.

559
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,790
I spoke to our supporters in Chennai,

560
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,000
even they are not able to wrap
their head around this.

561
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,290
No, no! I spoke to the French Government.

562
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,120
I hope this will not hinder the process.

563
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,450
Chief!

564
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,450
Ravi!

565
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,200
Chief!

566
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,250
Chief!

567
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,160
What happened?

568
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,290
-I can't do this anymore.
-What rubbish!

569
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,450
I don't have the strength
to fight anymore.

570
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,540
I quit the government.

571
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,750
Until the next council elections,
you be the PM.

572
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,290
Do you even understand what you're saying?

573
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,620
Bhaskaran, we need you!

574
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,620
No… you don't.

575
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,700
The world has changed.

576
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,830
There is no place for
soldiers like me in it.

577
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,200
I want to spend the rest of my days alone.

578
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,620
Congratulations, Prime Minister!

579
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,080
It's not a secret.

580
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,450
PM Basu hates our people!

581
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,290
I think, PM Basu did this to please
her old friend Rupatunga.

582
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,040
I don't understand why these
people hate me so much.

583
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,950
I've done so much for them.

584
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,790
Sambit!

585
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,160
Call Rupatunga's office right away.

586
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,790
Fix a date for bilateral talks.

587
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,950
To be held in Chennai.

588
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,160
Ma'am, Chennai--

589
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,700
-Ma'am, I think--
-Just do as I say!

590
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,700
Rupatunga will think that…

591
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,950
we are behind Subbu's death.

592
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,580
Let him think like that.

593
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,830
I am sorry for your loss.

594
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,250
Sorry about your brother.

595
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,330
That Basu!

596
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,290
She always hated us!

597
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,620
In the past too…

598
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,660
she helped kill our movement.

599
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,790
Now, she killed my brother.

600
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,330
He was the only family I had.

601
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Bastards!

602
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,830
Brother!

603
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,790
I am with you…

604
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,790
in this war.

605
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,910
Whatever help you need…

606
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,700
just let me know.

607
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,700
Thank you, Sameer.

608
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,540
I want to make Basu pay for this.

609
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,370
Fuck!

610
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,290
I'll recover all the money I lost.

611
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,000
Motherfucking bastards!

612
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,040
Deal the cards. I'll be back.

613
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,330
-Hello?
-Selva, how are you?

614
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,540
Chief!

615
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,830
Chief!

616
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,000
I heard about Brother Subbu.

617
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,330
I can't bear it!

618
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,660
Selva, are you drunk?

619
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,450
No, no, Chief.

620
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,700
Clean up!

621
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
I'll call you back in a few minutes.

622
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,120
You told us that we are
not giving up on the war.

623
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,580
It has been a long wait, Chief.

624
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,870
I am itching to go back to war!

625
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,250
Can you stay sober, Selva?

626
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,700
Yes, of course, I can.

627
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,450
I expect my soldiers
to be completely focused.

628
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
I am sorry, Chief.

629
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,660
The alcohol numbed the pain,
but it never made me forget.

630
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,540
But now, I've realized that only
war can heal the wounds of war.

631
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,450
Selva, stop it!

632
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,040
Melodrama is for losers.

633
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,580
Put together a small team.

634
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,580
Who's left from before?

635
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,450
-We are four of us.
-Alright.

636
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,580
One more thing,
I am sending someone to help you.

637
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,790
What for? We are enough.

638
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,660
Don't ever question my wisdom, Selva.

639
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,700
We are not what we used to be.
We need help.

640
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,000
I need you to cooperate with him.

641
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,750
When do we start?

642
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,870
Now!

643
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,080
Have you bought your ticket?

644
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,500
Show me your ticket.

645
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,330
Hey!

646
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,370
Why do you need to stick
to that girl and stand?

647
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,870
Tie a saree to a bamboo pole and these
idiots will be all over it! Dogs!

648
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,790
Hey, shut up and get back in here!
Take this seat!

649
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,580
Following the death of
Subramaniam Palanivel…

650
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,200
the leader of
the Tamil Government in Exile,

651
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,250
Bhaskaran, has quit the movement.

652
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,870
The future of their decades-long
freedom struggle is uncertain.

653
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,000
Is this the end?

654
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,200
One day, our shoulders will be free

655
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,000
From the burden of all the sorrows

656
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:33,200
Motherland, goodbye!

657
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,750
Motherland, goodbye!

658
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,410
Raji?

659
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,250
Brother Selva!

660
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,330
How are you, Raji?

661
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,700
Getting by. I'd be lying if I told you
I hadn't thought of killing myself.

662
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,790
The movement decides what you
do with your life, remember?

663
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,790
I saw the news about Subbu's death.

664
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,750
Are they hunting us down now?

665
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,620
I got a call from Chief.

666
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,410
What did he say?

667
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,700
-Subbu's death must have--
-I hope things are going fine for you.

668
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,790
Ever had any trouble?
Any run-in with the cops?

669
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,080
No.

670
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,200
No, nothing.

671
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,290
Everything is fine.

672
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,870
Why, brother?

673
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,830
Quit your job…

674
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,910
and wait for the instructions.

675
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,750
Okay, brother.

676
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,870
You know what this means, Raji?

677
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,370
We have a mission.

678
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,410
I don't have to remind you…
martyrs never die.

679
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,120
Ready for the mission, Raji?

680
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,410
"I am the weapon my
motherland gave birth to!

681
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,330
I will fight for my cause!

682
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,870
I will protect our Tamil race!

683
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,080
I will lay down my
life for our motherland!"
