1
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,700
Raji?

2
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,500
Raji, can you hear me?

3
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,330
You'll be fine! Don't worry!

4
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,500
Medical kit!

5
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,870
The bullet went right through.

6
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,000
She's lost a lot of blood.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,620
We need to disinfect the wound
and stop the bleeding.

8
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,620
Do you think we can handle it?

9
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,450
How are you?

10
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,870
Alive!

11
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,120
The doctor said you'll be discharged soon.

12
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,410
I just got off the phone
with Milind's parents.

13
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,290
We lost a good man, Sri.

14
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,790
I am really sorry!

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,250
How are you feeling?

16
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,830
I am alright, sir. I am perfectly fine.

17
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,410
Sajid was in Veeraranyam
with the rebel fighters.

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,330
I am sure he's working with Sameer.

19
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,870
We know that Sameer is providing
them logistical support.

20
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,750
But I am really surprised they
have a man on the ground.

21
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,950
Sir, Sajid isn't any ordinary asset.

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,080
We've already seen how dangerous he is.

23
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I am aware of that.

24
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,620
Along with the bodies of Lankan soldiers
that were found at Point Pedro…

25
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,870
included the corpse
of an Indian civilian, as well.

26
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,580
And the description matches Jebaraj.

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,620
Jebaraj?

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,700
I am putting together
a special team to work closely

29
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,620
with the Tamil Nadu commando force…

30
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,620
for tactical ground support.

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,200
Sri, we have to stop
these people at all costs.

32
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,000
Sir, please convince the PM to delay
the bilateral talks with Sri Lanka.

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,950
Or change its location out of Chennai.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,330
Sri, I am trying! Believe me!

35
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,040
You have no idea how stubborn PM Basu is.

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,620
She hates being cornered.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,870
For now,
let's find out what their plan is.

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, sir.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,160
The Lankans have found
Jebaraj's body at Point Pedro.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,950
If Jebaraj and Raji…

41
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
went to Point Pedro together,

42
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,000
and if Raji knows that Jebaraj is dead…

43
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,660
then why did she go back to his house?

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,120
I am asking you again,
did Jebaraj tell you what he's up to?

45
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,290
He left last evening.

46
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,000
He hasn't come back since.

47
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,410
Where is he, sir?

48
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,160
Think calmly and tell me.

49
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,870
Okay, does Jebaraj keep anything hidden?

50
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,450
His life is in danger.

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,450
Tell us the truth if
you want him back alive.

52
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,330
Sir, he keeps everything in the storeroom.

53
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,200
I have never entered that room.

54
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,750
Storeroom?

55
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,580
JK!

56
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,950
Sri!

57
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,120
Raji came back to get the detonator.

58
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,410
They are planning an explosion.

59
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,000
I told that mad man!

60
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,000
The Indians will never support
us after this massacre.

61
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,500
Let us not assume that.

62
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,700
Should I talk to our people
there to try and fix this?

63
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,790
Shut up, Ravi.

64
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,580
The whole world is watching us.

65
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,580
Even the smallest of lapses
will have a big impact.

66
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,410
They will be all over us, again.

67
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,000
We need to find Bhaskaran
as soon as possible.

68
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Hey, Mahima!

69
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,620
Hey! What's up, bro?

70
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,450
Listen, you have to cover for me today.

71
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,160
Kalyan?

72
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,330
Your mom's radar always catches our lies.

73
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,040
Her radar isn't working nowadays.

74
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,080
If she calls you, tell her
we're meeting at the mall.

75
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,250
Okay, listen!

76
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,120
-So, what's your plan?
-Sister!

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,290
A movie.

78
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,660
I've got to go, bye.

79
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,750
Open the door!

80
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,410
Sister!

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,040
What is it?

82
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,080
Can't you wait a little?

83
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,620
Where are you going all
dressed up like this?

84
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,830
Don't annoy me!

85
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,120
Where are you going?

86
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,750
I am meeting Mahima at the mall.

87
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,200
Boyfriend.

88
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,950
-When will you be back?
-In the evening.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,870
Dinner?

90
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,750
I'll eat outside.
It's my friend's birthday.

91
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,750
Dhriti!

92
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,790
You've been going out every day.

93
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,620
-Can't you stay at home sometimes?
-What about you?

94
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,790
I barely see you at home!

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,330
I have a job to do!

96
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,870
And this is a home,
not a hotel or a lodge!

97
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,500
I am asking you something!

98
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,160
When will you be back?

99
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,950
It's my life, too!

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,410
I'll come when I am done!

101
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,410
Dhriti! I am--

102
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,160
You sent Papa away!

103
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,620
You happily go to your
office with your friend,

104
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,000
and you want me to stay at
this place all the time!

105
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,330
How selfish are you!

106
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,290
What!

107
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,290
Watch it!

108
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,450
You are still a child.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,950
Behave like one.

110
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,660
I know what's going on.

111
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,620
Papa isn't coming home…

112
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,410
and you guys are getting a divorce.

113
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,910
It's okay, Mom.

114
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,700
Don't worry, I am there for you.

115
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,120
Deepan!

116
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,200
I heard you were trying to meet me.

117
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
Sameer!

118
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,750
Yeah.

119
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,080
Only you can help me.

120
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,620
I need to find Bhaskaran.

121
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,620
I don't know where Bhaskaran is.

122
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,910
You know what Bhaskaran is planning?

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,910
If a friend of 30 years has no idea…

124
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,950
then how would I know?

125
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,080
See, the future of our government
is at stake here, Sameer.

126
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,620
Could you please, at least, tell
Bhaskaran to get in touch with me?

127
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,000
As I told you, I don't know
anything about Bhaskaran.

128
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,790
If you need any other help, let me know.

129
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,700
Anytime. Anywhere.

130
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,450
I am always with you.

131
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,370
The police have circulated
our pictures all over.

132
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,790
We cannot leave this hangar
until the mission is complete.

133
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,700
By now, they would have
figured we are planning a blast.

134
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,040
Before they figure out the other details…

135
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,160
we need to get it done.

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,950
Here is a list of things
I need immediately.

137
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,080
It will take me ten to twelve
hours to build a new detonator.

138
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,290
Hurry up!

139
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,620
The signing starts at 11:00 a.m.
at the convention center…

140
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,870
which is located over here,
in the west wing of the hotel.

141
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,870
This is our target.
I've mapped the route for the plane.

142
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,000
This is the best route.

143
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
There aren't any high-rise
buildings in the vicinity.

144
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,540
The plane will stay under the radar.

145
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
If Raji maintains course
for the next 60 seconds…

146
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,830
she'll be able to hit the target.

147
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,450
The nose and sides of the plane
will have the greatest impact.

148
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,000
We should completely pack those parts
of the plane with C4.

149
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,700
For a more lethal, bigger explosion.

150
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,620
Karthik!

151
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,080
I need the items on this list, quickly.

152
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,660
Brother Selva.

153
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,330
Raji's fever is getting out of control.

154
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,540
What happened?

155
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,660
Raji…

156
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,790
Prabhu, you need to get a doctor.

157
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,750
Right.

158
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,660
Brother Selva.

159
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,620
If Raji is unable to fly, I'll do it.

160
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,620
Karthik. The plane has to fly
below 1,000 meters…

161
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,250
via Sunguvarchathiram,
towards the Chennai coast.

162
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,080
It isn't an easy task.

163
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,290
Not getting spotted by
the radar is not easy.

164
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,950
Only Raji can do it.

165
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,410
Mr. Deepan, it's been a while.

166
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,200
-What is it I can do for you?
-I want you to find this man.

167
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,450
Bhaskaran Palanivel.

168
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,040
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

169
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,500
Find him, Adrian.

170
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,950
Please, reconsider it, ma'am.

171
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,120
There is going to be an attack
on you is a certainty.

172
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,950
Please, postpone the meeting. Please.

173
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,870
Is this a joke?

174
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,000
Ma'am, Major Sameer is
supporting the rebels.

175
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,080
This intel is absolutely accurate, ma'am.

176
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,540
And what are you doing
about this information?

177
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,000
You increase the budgets every year.

178
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,950
If you can't make optimum
use of this money, tell me.

179
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,540
I can use it to fund
the Farmers' Welfare Program.

180
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,950
That is not fair, ma'am.

181
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,290
Despite you having all the resources…

182
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,580
a few rebels can shake up the country!

183
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,290
Is it fair?

184
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,870
I want to bring India
to the center stage of world politics…

185
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,160
and you people just--

186
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,410
There is a law of the jungle
that if the lion becomes weak…

187
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,410
the jackals get ready to feast.

188
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,580
Prime Minister Basu is
neither weak nor scared.

189
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,620
Ma'am, please go ahead
with meeting the President, but…

190
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,580
do it somewhere else.
It is a security nightmare, ma'am.

191
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,830
-The people here--
-They organized protests against me!

192
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,830
But I have a mother's heart.

193
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,120
When they were hit by floods,
I was the first one to get there.

194
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,910
I allotted a 500-crore relief package!

195
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,160
Whether it is life or politics,
when children start believing

196
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,200
that mother's love is unconditional,
they tend to get out of hand.

197
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,540
The meeting will happen in Chennai.

198
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,290
Where the hell have you brought me?

199
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,870
You're getting me into trouble,
aren't you?

200
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,910
-I am doubling my fee.
-Don't say you can't.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,370
Money is not an issue.
Start the treatment.

202
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,290
Let's go!

203
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,200
Bullet wound?

204
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,830
I won't tell anyone.

205
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Please let me go.

206
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,580
I can refer other doctors to you.

207
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,040
Doctor, trust me.
There is nothing to be afraid of.

208
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,500
You have the responsibility
to save a life.

209
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Please, hurry up with the treatment.

210
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,910
I feel lost.

211
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,830
I am confused.

212
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,200
I've worked so hard on my family and…

213
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,200
now, it's all just falling apart.

214
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,580
I feel I am the reason, and…

215
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,290
I just hate myself!

216
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,410
I should talk to Sri.

217
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
I think I should.

218
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,290
-I just--
-Suchitra!

219
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,700
You know what people say?

220
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,830
"The truth will set you free.

221
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,250
Honesty is the best policy."

222
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
It's all bullshit.

223
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,120
If you tell Srikant the truth…

224
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,790
it will end your marriage.

225
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,950
I am telling you this
from personal experience.

226
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,620
Not as a counselor.

227
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't do it!

228
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,450
-What happened?
-Nothing.

229
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,160
-Nice perfume, by the way.
-Don't change the topic.

230
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,830
Is everything alright?

231
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,540
Yes, everything is fine.

232
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,370
Did your dad find out about
me coming over to your place?

233
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,410
No. In fact, he's still out of town.

234
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,200
Like, 500 rupees for a ticket!

235
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,580
Let us just download
movies and watch them.

236
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,620
Yeah.

237
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,870
Listen, Dhriti…

238
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,620
What?

239
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,370
Nothing, I was just…

240
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,200
-Nothing!
-What is wrong with you, Kalyan?

241
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,410
Ever since we've met, you seem distracted.

242
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,910
We jinx it every time we kiss.

243
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,950
No, I didn't mean it like that.

244
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,120
I was just asking…

245
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,160
I don't know!

246
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,750
Actually, Mom and Dad aren't
going to be home for a while.

247
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,620
So, you are calling your girlfriend over?

248
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,410
I mean, girlfriend…

249
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,330
You are the worst
chicken I have ever seen.

250
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,620
Maybe, that is why, I feel safe with you?

251
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,950
Get your bike out.
I'll just inform Mom and be there.

252
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,950
Okay.

253
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,200
-Hi.
-Got any calls?

254
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,750
From your mom? No.

255
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,580
Good. I am doing homework with you.

256
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,160
-Are you serious?
-What do you mean?

257
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,330
You are staying over?

258
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,000
Listen, don't forget protection!

259
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,410
Please! I am not going
to do anything stupid.

260
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,620
But listen, whenever Mom calls you,
call me immediately, okay?

261
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes.

262
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,790
And listen. Take care, okay?

263
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,370
Hello, Dhriti? Where are you?

264
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,450
I forgot my project report at Mahima's.
I am going to get it back.

265
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,370
-Dhriti, it's nearly eight o'clock!
-It's okay, Mom.

266
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,750
What it's okay? It's not okay!

267
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,040
Give me the address.
I'll come and pick you up.

268
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,200
Stop it, Mom. I'll take a rickshaw. Bye!

269
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,160
I know where she is.

270
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,160
-Tell me.
-Can I get chocolate?

271
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,540
Do I look like your father?

272
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,660
Where is she?

273
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,870
Mahima is just an excuse, Mom.

274
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,540
She has gone to see her boyfriend.

275
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,290
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

276
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,910
Mom, half a chocolate?

277
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,410
-Brushed your teeth?
-Yes. Didn't you see?

278
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,750
So, then it's settled, no chocolate.

279
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,120
Well played, Mom.

280
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,790
Muthu.

281
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,580
Tiwari.

282
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,910
To Milind.

283
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,080
To Milind.

284
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,250
To a hero.

285
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,790
We have to be vigilant now, got it?

286
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,830
Keep an eye on that side.

287
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,000
How are you feeling?

288
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,790
Just rest today.

289
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,620
You will feel better tomorrow.

290
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,950
My work here is done, Raji.

291
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,450
You're all set, too.

292
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,120
I am going to Mumbai in the morning.

293
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,160
I have some pending work there.

294
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,370
I've never met a soldier like you.

295
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,910
I will always remember this mission.

296
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,660
I am not saying this to please you.

297
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,830
I am lucky that I got to work with you.

298
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,870
Answer the phone, Dhriti.

299
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
The number you're trying to call is not--

300
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,080
-Hi, Auntie.
-Mahima, hi.

301
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,410
Is Dhriti with you?

302
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,330
Auntie, she just left.

303
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,080
She isn't answering her phone, so…

304
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,580
Auntie, her battery was low.

305
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,160
So, maybe, the phone is on silent.

306
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,080
Oh!

307
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,790
Alright.

308
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,700
Thanks, dear.

309
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,120
Okay! Good night, Auntie.

310
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,500
The number you're trying
to call is not answering.

311
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,450
Guys, the schedule for PM Basu
and Rupatunga's meet has been announced.

312
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,120
No change at all.

313
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,160
Damn! They screw around and we suffer.

314
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,910
I can die for the country,
but not for this petty politics.

315
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,040
You aren't putting your life at stake
for politics or some politician.

316
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,870
We are here to protect a position.

317
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,250
No matter who fills that position
and whatever their ideology is…

318
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,410
shouldn't matter to us. Governments
will come, governments will go.

319
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,370
National security is our duty.

320
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,750
Right?

321
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,700
Of course.

322
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,200
That is our bloody duty!

323
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,040
That is our bloody job!

324
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,120
We have to find Raji.

325
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,750
That is the only way
we can stop this attack.

326
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,540
Mahima, hi!
Sorry for calling you so late, but…

327
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,410
Dhriti has not come home yet.

328
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,950
Did she tell you where she was going?

329
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,580
Auntie, she left my place at nine o'clock.

330
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,910
Mahima, I spoke to you at ten o'clock,
and you said she had just left.

331
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,410
-Yes, Auntie. I meant to say--
-Mahima! Enough is enough!

332
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,580
Tell me where Dhriti is right now!

333
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
Or else, I am going to call the police!

334
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,120
Auntie, she--

335
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,250
Just tell me where she is!

336
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,370
No bullshitting! Tell me right now!

337
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,290
Actually, Auntie, Dhriti is out
on a date with her boyfriend.

338
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,660
Boyfriend?

339
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,700
Okay, what's his name?

340
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,200
Kalyan.

341
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,370
Do you have his number?

342
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,080
Sorry, Auntie…
but I don't have his number.

343
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,500
Do you know where they went?

344
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,330
After the movie,
she went over to his place.

345
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,910
Okay, give me his address.

346
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't have it, Auntie.

347
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,830
Mahima, you are her best
friend and you know nothing?

348
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,000
Is he your classmate?

349
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,330
No, Auntie. They had met online.

350
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,790
Do you have a photo?

351
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,870
No, Auntie.

352
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,910
Actually, I've only met
him a couple of times.

353
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,910
Sorry, Auntie!

354
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,700
Enough now! How much will you drink?

355
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,160
Stop!

356
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,370
You drank all of this by yourself.

357
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,870
And then, you school me!

358
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,370
Pick up the phone!

359
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,080
Let it be.

360
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,660
What's with your ego, man?

361
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,950
She is still calling.
Just pick up the phone.

362
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,540
Hey!

363
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,410
Arvind?

364
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,450
Hey, hi.

365
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,410
Hi.

366
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
All okay?

367
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,080
Your marriage isn't a sham, you are!

368
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,000
Look, it's an unknown number.

369
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,450
That's more important than your wife,
right? I am sure you'll take this.

370
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,370
Hello?

371
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,000
Srikant, Arvind here.

372
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,580
Suchi's friend… colleague.

373
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,370
Oh, what happened?

374
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,450
Is Suchi okay?

375
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,330
Suchi has been trying to reach you.
Just talk to her.

376
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,870
Sri…

377
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,750
Dhriti hasn't come home yet.

378
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,910
Where is she?

379
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,910
With her boyfriend.

380
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,790
She has a boyfriend!

381
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,290
Who is he?

382
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't know. Mahima said it
was some guy called Kalyan.

383
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,870
Where did she go with him?

384
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,870
I don't know, Sri.

385
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,370
How could you not know, Suchi?
What the hell is going on over there?

386
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,540
Stop yelling!

387
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,450
Okay, let me track her.
Put the phone down.

388
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,250
What happened?

389
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Yes, Sri. Tell me.

390
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,120
I need your help to track a number.

391
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,080
For personal use?

392
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,870
It is bloody personal!

393
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,450
Sometimes, I wonder if I am working
for the government or you!

394
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,370
Why do you always make me do all this?

395
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,290
For God's sake!

396
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,910
I am sending you the number, okay?
You have to track it.

397
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,830
It's urgent.

398
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,200
Sure, send it to me.

399
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,250
Tiwari, will you tell me what happened?

400
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,790
Sri, we have tracked Dhriti's phone.

401
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,500
It was found on a local train.

402
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,080
We've questioned some commuters,
but no one has a clue.

403
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,500
-I am coming to Mumbai.
-Sri, maybe, she dropped her phone?

404
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,000
Ajit, I know my daughter.

405
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,120
She has never even lost a pin.

406
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,620
Something is wrong.

407
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,200
Are you suggesting…

408
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,580
We have to face the fact.

409
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,160
My daughter has been kidnapped.

410
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,410
And I hope…

411
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,950
I am wrong.

412
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,200
I'll be home by 5:00 a.m.

413
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,120
Did you find anything?

414
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,830
Her phone has been found on a local train…

415
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,200
but nobody has seen her.

416
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,620
She fought with me before leaving.

417
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,580
I had no idea she had a boyfriend!

418
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,250
We're trying to get
more details about Kalyan.

419
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,000
We've sent a team to Mahima's place, too.

420
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,410
She doesn't know anything!

421
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,910
She doesn't have his number or address!

422
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,580
She doesn't even have a photo with him!

423
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,200
Suchi, I will find Dhriti. It is my duty.
