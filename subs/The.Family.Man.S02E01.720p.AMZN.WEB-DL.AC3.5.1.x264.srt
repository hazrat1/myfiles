1
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,450
Sir!

2
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,580
What is this, man?

3
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,160
Look at this news, Deepan.

4
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,290
What's new? This is old news.

5
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,330
These idiots have killed me so many times.

6
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,330
Where's Subbu?

7
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,450
He is near the tents.

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,040
-I hope we are ready for the operation.
-Yes.

9
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,620
We are waiting for some
more weapons to arrive.

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,200
We have no time, guys! Step on it!

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,200
Focus on the job.

12
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,000
Subbu and his team seem
well-prepared, as always.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,620
Yes, that goes inside. Yes, just like
that. All right? Everything is set now.

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,330
And from tomorrow,
you will be our leader's shadow.

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,540
-Understood?
-Subbu!

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Check this out.

17
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,080
They are messing with us.

18
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,700
Brother, three more days.

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,580
After we hit Rupatunga, the world
will know who is dead and who is alive.

20
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,330
Let us review the plan.

21
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,290
Sir!

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,950
We hit their forward bases,
about 11 km from here.

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,870
If all goes well, we will regain
control of the highways.

24
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,410
Next, our cells in Colombo will hit
the parliament, airports, and the harbor.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,750
-Nice plan.
-Good job.

26
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,160
Brother, Selva is setting up
the 12.7 mm machine gun.

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,500
Please, take a look at it.

28
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,660
Bhaskaran!

29
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,000
Even after all these years of fighting…

30
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,950
Subbu is excited about every
battle like it is his first.

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,200
He just loves war!

32
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,250
-My brother loves freedom, not war.
-Selva!

33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,000
Hurry up! It'll be dark soon!

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,040
Yes.

35
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Selva… have you tested
the grenade launcher?

36
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,540
I'll test it today.

37
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,250
Hey, finish it right now!

38
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,330
Understood?

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,830
We can't afford to fail this time.

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,910
What are you thinking about?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
-We have to strike as planned.
-Nothing.

42
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,290
I was hoping that Rupatunga
would agree for peace talks.

43
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,120
Idiot Rupatunga!

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,370
If we want to end this war…

45
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,950
then Rupatunga is our only hope.

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,870
He will offer us the same shit again.

47
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,250
Autonomy.

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,910
What we want is freedom.

49
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,120
Wonder when you'll ditch those bastards.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
Stop talking politics, and start fighting.

51
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,700
Back straight! Chin up!

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,870
-That's right!
-Subbu!

53
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,580
A dead soldier is no good.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,330
Don't preach to me about death.

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,950
We not only lost our families…

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,700
but also witnessed the loot,
murder, and rapes of countless innocents.

57
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,080
You stick to politics
and eloquent speeches, Deepan.

58
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,410
Leave the war to us soldiers.

59
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,660
Even I lost my family, Subbu.

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,330
Without eloquent speeches
and politics, this war will never end.

61
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,660
Calm down, brother!

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,080
We wouldn't be here
without Deepan's hard work.

63
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,410
Okay, all right.
Everyone, help yourselves.

64
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,830
It will be a few days
before your next hot meal.

65
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,160
Ilango, is everything ready?

66
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,790
Everyone must be tired and hungry.

67
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,000
Call everyone to eat!

68
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,160
Everyone, come eat!

69
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,580
Hurry up, everyone! Let's eat!

70
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,870
Selva! Tell them to hurry up!

71
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,040
-Sir!
-Did we get Bhaskaran?

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,330
Neither Bhaskaran, Deepan, or Subbu.

73
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,790
All three got away.

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,250
We can't let them get away again!
Understood?

75
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,200
Yes, sir!

76
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,040
We can't just run away like this.

77
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,410
If we die,
so does our decades-long movement.

78
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,370
There is no other way!

79
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,750
What do we do now?

80
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,120
We are leaving our homeland?

81
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,750
We can't stay here anymore.

82
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,620
We will save the movement
at the right time.

83
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,540
Brother!

84
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,120
What is this madness?

85
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,040
We are leaving our homeland?

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,370
The future of our struggle
rests on our shoulders!

87
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,790
The three of us need to survive.

88
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,250
For the sake of our dead family,

89
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,000
the thousands of innocents that died…

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,700
don't you think I will continue the fight?

91
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,540
Our time will come.

92
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,910
Find out where they are headed.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,290
Minister Basu has assured me she wouldn't
allow any rebels to get into India.

94
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,000
Did the Indians respond
to our distress messages?

95
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,250
I have been trying to contact
them for the past 48 hours.

96
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,290
We did not get any response from them.

97
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,580
They said they will help,
but they abandoned us!

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,120
We are in this situation
because we trusted Basu!

99
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,290
Backstabbers!

100
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,120
But guess who did respond?

101
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,160
I have spoken to Local 52. He has a ship
waiting for us in international waters.

102
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,370
They destroyed our
people, raped our women,

103
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,290
and mercilessly murdered our children.

104
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,870
They will pay.

105
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,620
Hi!

106
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,580
Good morning.

107
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,250
What's the time, Srikant?

108
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,370
It's 9:20 a.m.

109
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,750
So, you're late, right?

110
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,910
The company policy says I can come in
anytime between 9:00 and 9:30, right?

111
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,750
But you could show up
at nine o'clock, couldn't you?

112
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,080
Well, I could even show up at 8:30 a.m.

113
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,580
Do you know how much money
Mukesh Ambani makes per minute?

114
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,620
Guess.

115
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,500
Ten… maybe, fifteen thousand?

116
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,040
He makes over a crore per minute.

117
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,410
That means,
he makes around two lakhs per second.

118
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,160
You know, if he drops a 2,000-rupee note,
he doesn't bother to pick it up.

119
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,580
He doesn't even touch it! Do you know why?

120
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,330
Because he'll lose two lakh rupees!

121
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,910
That's what I am talking about!

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,330
Every second counts, Srikant.

123
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,410
In this new world,
it's not enough to do the bare minimum.

124
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,120
You don't want to be that
"minimum guy," do you?

125
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,250
Good! I aim for perfection,
and I'll settle for excellence.

126
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes. In my conference room, right now!

127
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,450
It's the same bullshit every day.

128
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,080
That little weasel is going to teach
me the importance of time?

129
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,200
All talk and no cock.

130
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,620
And what the hell is a "minimum guy"?

131
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,160
Sure, go ahead and laugh,
but this is all because of you.

132
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,370
All because of me?

133
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,450
You hounded me every day,
"Corporate world! Corporate world!

134
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,120
Nine to five! Nine to five!"

135
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,290
Do you know how many people
want a job here at Cache Me?

136
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,830
Tanmay is a young achiever. Maybe,
you can learn a few things from him.

137
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,540
This is a new world!

138
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,450
New world? What the hell has changed?

139
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,160
Same government!
Same war! Same terrorists!

140
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,660
Pakistan is now under
an ultra right-wing regime!

141
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,200
And now, ISI is back to--

142
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,950
Sri, saving the world
is not your job anymore.

143
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,500
Forget Pakistan and ISI!

144
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,290
And maybe, start thinking
about your TPS reports!

145
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,080
Mr. Rupatunga, you keep saying
India is Sri Lanka's elder sister…

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,040
and you do this?

147
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,370
I guess, the Chinese are
your best friends now?

148
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,200
Hope your welcome party for
the Chinese Premier went very well?

149
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,120
Ms. Basu, after all these years,
you haven't changed a bit.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,330
The Chinese Premier's
visit was just a formality.

151
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,160
I hear that you are planning to give…

152
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,000
the North Sri Lanka port
construction deal to the Chinese?

153
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,160
The Chinese want it, yes.

154
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,120
But we still haven't decided on
it, Ms. Basu.

155
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,410
We cannot let the Chinese
control our Indian Ocean.

156
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,540
It's between us.

157
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,500
Well, the Chinese
are making a great offer.

158
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,450
We are a small and developing
nation, and we need all the help.

159
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,120
Mr. Rupatunga,
you have forgotten our help…

160
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,910
when you were struggling
to solve the rebel problem?

161
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,700
What do you have in mind?

162
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,580
We are willing to extend a very
low-interest long-term loan.

163
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,950
We'll build a port, train your
people, and hand it over.

164
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,620
No strings attached.

165
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,950
Let me think about it.

166
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,750
Mr. Rupatunga,
there is something else in your mind.

167
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,620
What is it?

168
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,540
I need a small thing, Ms. Basu.

169
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,250
A wanted man in our country
is in India at this moment.

170
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,370
Bhaskaran's brother…

171
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,700
Subbu Subramaniam Palanivel
is in Chennai right now…

172
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,040
to rally the support of some MLAs and MPs.

173
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,290
You know it very well, that this
organization is already banned in India.

174
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,450
I got some information
that France is considering

175
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,620
recognizing this government.

176
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,200
Can you believe that?

177
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,370
These people want to form a government

178
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,830
and operate from London.

179
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,040
-If you could give Subbu to us--
-But Subbu is not a wanted man in India.

180
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Arresting him will be a big problem
in India! Especially in Tamil Nadu!

181
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,870
Mr. Rupatunga, what else can I do for you?

182
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,160
Ms. Basu, we know we are a very small
nation, but please, allow us our pride.

183
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,870
If France and the UK
recognize this government,

184
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,040
then, not too far away, very soon…

185
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,830
they will sit with us at the UN,
and I cannot…

186
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,000
I cannot allow that.

187
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,790
I will see what I can do.

188
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,540
That's all I ask, Ms. Basu.

189
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,580
I'll wait for your call.

190
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,200
Hey, Tiwari!

191
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,120
Hey!

192
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,580
-How have you been?
-You're looking smart!

193
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,120
-Have a seat!
-I hope you aren't having an affair!

194
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,750
You've lost your mind! Just sit down.

195
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,160
Here you go, it's my treat.
So, order yourself a feast.

196
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,790
I could buy my whole vada
pav stall for these prices.

197
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,450
-Excuse me, one Caesar salad.
-From vada pav to salads!

198
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,040
And one portion of garlic bread.

199
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,290
-And one fresh lime soda.
-Okay.

200
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,200
What about you, sir?

201
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll have pasta.

202
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,580
Sure, sir. Which one?

203
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,830
-Agg… leeyo… olio?
-Aglio olio, sir.

204
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,790
Anything to drink, sir?

205
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,790
-Two hundred fifty bucks for a Coke?
-Just order what you like.

206
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,120
I'd rather die than pay
that much for a Coke.

207
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,040
You just bring me that pasta.
I'll have a cold drink somewhere else.

208
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
For now, get me water.

209
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,540
Still or sparkling, sir?

210
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,830
Just regular water?

211
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,950
Yes, sir. Okay. Be there shortly.

212
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,250
What the hell is this?

213
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,000
I hope they know this
restaurant is in India.

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,370
Why does that dish have such a weird name?

215
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,370
So, how's it going?

216
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,410
The economy is in deep shit.

217
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,830
They cut our Diwali bonus by half.

218
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,200
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

219
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,620
You guys are going to be really busy soon.

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,790
A hard-line party is coming
to power in Pakistan.

221
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,040
Kulkarni has had a bunch of
high-level meetings about this.

222
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,750
Sharma has briefed us about this, too.

223
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,750
You always know what's going
on, don't you?

224
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,410
You don't really mean it when you
say you love your IT job, do you?

225
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,290
Your heart is still very much at TASC.

226
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,200
-I am very happy! Very happy!
-I don't believe you!

227
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,620
I don't want the burden
of people's lives or deaths on me.

228
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,830
If only we'd reached
Orion Chemicals faster.

229
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,870
Stop blaming yourself.
It wasn't your fault, so why do you--

230
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,540
Leave all that!

231
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,120
How's Suchi?

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,330
I don't understand, Talpade.

233
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,660
I reach home on time.

234
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,120
I spend time with the kids.

235
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,500
I cook breakfast in the morning,
and I cook dinner at night.

236
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,750
Still, Suchi just isn't happy.

237
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,540
Every time I ask her, she just says,
"Oh, I am fine! Nothing's wrong!"

238
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,120
Do yourself a favor, Tiwari.

239
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,160
Come back to TASC.

240
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,540
We will tolerate you
no matter how boring you are.

241
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,830
Suchi must just be fed up with you by now!

242
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,040
-Excuse me, where's my order?
-Sir, it'll be here shortly.

243
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,080
Thank you.

244
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Mr. Srikant, may I have a word
with you if you don't mind?

245
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,750
What has Dhriti done now?

246
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,120
-I hope you haven't messed up!
-I haven't! Promise!

247
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,660
-Good evening, ma'am!
-Good evening.

248
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,040
All well? Any problem at school?

249
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,830
-Or the compound? Or anything else?
-All good, all good. Thank you.

250
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,160
I just want to have
a quick word about Atharv.

251
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,700
-Atharv?
-Yes!

252
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,040
He's been very hyperactive.

253
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:14,120
He keeps playing this shooting video game,
and he's very hard to handle.

254
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,620
In his generation,
half the kids have ADHD.

255
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,790
A--AD?

256
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,450
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder, Mr. Srikant.

257
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,790
And we don't want Atharv to have
any problems now, do we?

258
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,250
Please, stop buying him
these expensive gifts!

259
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,410
No, no. Those are not
expensive gifts, ma'am.

260
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,410
He has an Apple Watch now, I believe.

261
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,450
No, no. It's just a Chinese replica!

262
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,790
Don't tell him, please.

263
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,870
You see, at their age, they have a lot
of energy, and nowhere to channel it.

264
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,040
To channelize precisely that,
we put him in music classes.

265
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,660
He has been learning for two years now.

266
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,370
So, I am sure he'll be
able to channel his energy!

267
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,790
That music class!

268
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,500
You see, I always encourage the children…

269
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,700
-to pursue whatever they like,
-Yeah.

270
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,200
and not really worry about the results.

271
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,830
But in Atharv's case…

272
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,330
You understand what I mean, Mr. Srikant.

273
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,580
Pa, pick any song in the world.

274
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,080
I can play anything now!

275
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,040
Do you intend to torture me
with that all the way home?

276
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,870
Papa, please! Name a song!

277
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,160
"Sare jahan se achha."

278
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,750
What kind of a song is that?
Name a song from a movie.

279
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,500
From a movie?

280
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,870
Alright, then.

281
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,290
O, darling! O, darling!

282
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,410
O, darling! O, darling!

283
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Flowers are blooming--

284
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,330
What song is this?

285
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,370
Don't ask anyone else that,
unless you want to be humiliated!

286
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,040
It's a song from a classic film
called, "Sholay."

287
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,750
I am going to play "Senorita" for you.

288
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,450
Don't blow so hard,
it'll come out of your rear end.

289
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,250
It's hot! Please, use a coaster.

290
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,660
Hello! Dhriti! Why are you late?

291
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,120
Didn't your tuition
class get over two hours ago?

292
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,870
-Boyfriend?
-Shut up!

293
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,750
I was at Mahima's house, studying.

294
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,200
We have a test coming up.

295
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,290
All right, come to have dinner.

296
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,330
-Hey, Suchi!
-Yes?

297
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,750
Should we go watch a film this Saturday?

298
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,160
Yes, yes!

299
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,910
Let's decide on Saturday?

300
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,660
I need a new laptop.

301
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,750
Now, don't tell me you have all your money
stuck in the new house you've bought!

302
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,750
Oh, come on! Come on!

303
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,370
Just because he is a boy,
he gets everything.

304
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,660
And because I am a girl,
all I get are excuses.

305
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,120
This is the problem with our patriarchal
society, with its deep-rooted misogyny.

306
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,910
Suchi… did you hear her?

307
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,540
How good is her English!

308
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,410
Such command over the language!

309
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,040
She writes an essay even for
"True or False" questions these days.

310
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,080
-Shut up!
-You shut up!

311
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,290
All right! That's enough! Peace.

312
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,910
-Come on, give me your phone.
-Just one more game!

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,410
Nope! No more phones during dinner, okay?

314
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,700
A family that eats together…

315
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,830
stays together, okay?

316
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,950
Healthy families follow this rule.

317
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,910
-And what if I have a special class?
-And what if I had a special camp?

318
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,750
-And I have to study late and get up late?
-And if I had a fever, what then?

319
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,080
And what if I had piles!

320
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,580
What?

321
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,120
Why the hell do you always
have to focus on the exception?

322
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,000
Unless there is a catastrophic
earthquake that kills us all…

323
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,750
I am sure we can have dinner together!

324
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,910
-Atharv, no more phones. Family time!
-Papa, I just have one level left, please?

325
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,080
-It's a family rule.
-Please?

326
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,040
-Family time.
-Please?

327
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,000
-Family time.
-Please?

328
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,830
-Family time, goddammit!
-Srikant!

329
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,620
Sorry.

330
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,370
How was your day?

331
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,540
Come on, guys!

332
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,290
One by one, we'll all share something.

333
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,290
Like, "How was your day,
and what all did you do today?"

334
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,080
Dhriti, how was your day?

335
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,790
There's nothing to tell, Pa.
I went to school.

336
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,000
I attended classes and then, I came home.

337
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,750
That's it? That's all you did today?

338
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,450
Okay, I have exciting news for you guys.

339
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,540
Today, our broker sent me the
first photograph of our new house.

340
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,500
-Show! Show it to us!
-Okay, calm down! I am showing it.

341
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,580
Okay, I am breaking the phone rule,
because this is very exciting.

342
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,160
-This--
-That's our building?

343
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
No, no. That's not our building.
That's Tower A.

344
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,700
You see this space here? That's Tower C.

345
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,040
It's upcoming. That's where we'll live.

346
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,290
The foundation has been laid out, and
very soon, they'll build the ten floors.

347
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,290
What?

348
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,120
Be patient. Everything will work out.

349
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,910
So, Suchi, tell us.

350
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,870
What did you do? How was your day?

351
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,870
Well, I didn't do much. I watched some TV.

352
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,200
-Then, I cooked.
-Okay.

353
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,790
Then, I watched TV all over again.

354
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,250
And tomorrow, I have an exciting
day of watching television and…

355
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,500
doing absolutely nothing.

356
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,830
Why aren't you ever in
a good mood anymore?

357
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,620
Sometimes, I think,
you just don't like my face!

358
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,160
I was trying to spend some
quality time with the family.

359
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,540
-And you just keep--
-Sri! Just stop stretching it now!

360
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,540
Why don't you leave it?

361
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,750
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill!

362
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,330
I am stretching it?

363
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,450
Suchi, everything is
not an argument, okay?

364
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,620
Sometimes, I feel, a fight breaks
out even before I open my mouth.

365
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,580
Sri…

366
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,160
I am sorry.

367
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,500
I didn't mean it like that.

368
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,750
Actually…

369
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,200
it's not your fault.

370
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,000
I…

371
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,000
I have been seeing a counselor
for a few days now.

372
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,750
I know you don't like these things, but…

373
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,120
would you be willing to come
to see the counselor with me?

374
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,080
I think it'll be good.

375
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,250
Tiwari. It's Puneet.

376
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,160
-Yes, Puneet.
-Sir.

377
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,870
Vaibhav Therani's phone just came online.

378
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,540
Maybe, it just got a signal.

379
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,870
He's at Orion Chemicals.

380
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,870
What?

381
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,500
But Milind and Zoya said…

382
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,620
Puneet, track their phones.

383
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Sir, it's out of coverage.

384
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,580
Their last known location
is Orion Chemicals.

385
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,910
Thirty-seven minutes ago.

386
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,040
Puneet, send backup
to Orion Chemicals right away.

387
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,080
Alert all units.

388
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
We're on our way.

389
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,120
Fuck!

390
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,450
Stay with me, Milind.

391
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,120
Milind.

392
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,000
The disposal team is entering the core.

393
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,290
Disabled outlets for E1, E2, and E3. Over.

394
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,750
The scrubber tank is active.

395
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,290
Restarting the flare tower.

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,540
Nitrogen back to normal
levels in E1. Over.

397
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,290
"A major disaster averted,"
claim government sources.

398
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,660
"Casualties could've been in
thousands," says the Home Minister.

399
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,660
This is the first-ever incident
after the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

400
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,620
The Delhi Police categorically maintain…

401
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,950
The Central Government
has set up a high alert…

402
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,370
The government is blowing its own trumpet.

403
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,580
Gentlemen, listen up!

404
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,660
We cannot appear to be weak.

405
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,410
We cannot let this be a terrorist win.

406
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,450
Send him in.

407
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,040
Mr. Ahuja, the CEO of Orion Chemicals.

408
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,200
Before we go any further,
Mr. Ahuja, let me tell you,

409
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,290
whatever we say in this room today…

410
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,500
remains in these four walls.

411
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,620
You know, we cannot…

412
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,080
call this a terrorist attack.

413
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,080
It was…

414
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,040
a gas leak.

415
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,620
Equipment failure.

416
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,830
An accident.

417
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,000
But sir, this is--

418
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,160
Whatever reason you pick for the gas leak…

419
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,910
it better be technically sound.

420
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,790
There are several experts on Twitter…

421
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,290
who will dig deep and find out
any flaw in anything.

422
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,450
But sir, it's not right.

423
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,700
Mr. Ahuja, would you like us
to pin this on your employee?

424
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,660
The… the one who helped the terrorists?

425
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,370
-What's his name?
-Vaibhav Therani.

426
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,250
-Sorry?
-Vaibhav Therani, sir.

427
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,700
-He was under pressure!
-Sri!

428
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,120
We have already announced that we
have stopped a major terrorist attack.

429
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,370
We can't tell them we failed now.

430
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,250
Mr. Ahuja, this is your only choice.

431
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,370
But sir, this will cause
serious damage to our brand image.

432
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,910
Mr. Ahuja, this is not a request!

433
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,450
Look, Mr. Ahuja.

434
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,330
I'll ensure that your company gets a grant
from one of the government's schemes.

435
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,330
It'll cover all your losses.

436
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,700
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Ahuja.

437
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,910
You may leave.

438
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,620
Sharma!

439
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,790
Thank you.

440
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Anything else, Sri?

441
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,450
What is it? You can tell me.

442
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,750
I am done.

443
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,500
Done?

444
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,500
Sri, please!

445
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,950
Hello, gentlemen!

446
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,080
Please! Have a seat!

447
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,790
I only have six minutes,
so let's not waste time.

448
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,580
Sambit, start, please.

449
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,200
-Have a look.
-And please, have a seat.

450
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,290
We've received intel that…

451
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,660
the younger brother of Bhaskaran, Subbu…

452
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,790
Subramaniam Palanivel
is in Chennai right now.

453
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,540
He's there lobbying with his benefactors,

454
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,080
and then, these pro-rebel voices will
rally together to gain recognition…

455
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,870
for their Government in Exile.

456
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,540
The Lankans want Subbu, so I was
discussing possible options with madam.

457
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,910
Madam, he is the Foreign Minister of
the Lankan Tamil Government in Exile!

458
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,910
And you want us to hand
him over to the Lankans?

459
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,660
There will be a huge uproar!

460
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,120
It's a bad idea.

461
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,370
It'll lead to utter chaos!

462
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,830
You just handle your
external affairs' work.

463
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,120
Leave the handling of the chaos…

464
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,750
to me.

465
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,870
But ma'am,
he is not a wanted man in India.

466
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,830
So?

467
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,000
He's wanted by our allies.

468
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,330
May I just ask, why are we doing this?

469
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,500
I just don't get it!

470
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,290
Mr. Kulkarni…

471
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,790
the whole world was laughing when China
built a port in Southern Sri Lanka.

472
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,410
I won't allow the same
mistake to repeat itself.

473
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,540
If they manage to get
a stronghold in Sri Lanka…

474
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,790
then the Indian Ocean is gone forever.

475
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,410
I want this port deal at any cost.

476
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,040
Madam, allow me to say
that this is a very bad idea.

477
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,620
Yes, I agree with Kulkarni.

478
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,870
The repercussions of this in Tamil Nadu--

479
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,370
I see the big picture.

480
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,120
I don't mind making a few people unhappy

481
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,160
for us to beat the Chinese.
I am fine with that.

482
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,410
I will put up with it.

483
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,750
So, now, tell me. If we did have
to hand Subbu over to the Lankans…

484
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,370
then what would be your plan of action?

485
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,870
The building doesn't
even have an elevator.

486
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,620
My legs are fucked.

487
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,120
Sir!

488
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,080
Won't you invite us in?

489
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,290
Please.

490
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,410
Give me a glass of water!

491
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,450
Why doesn't your elevator work?

492
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,910
How does he live in this mess?

493
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,200
Comfy now?

494
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,160
How are you, Milind?

495
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,540
How's your therapy coming along?

496
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,870
It's going fine.

497
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,120
Milind, come back to work.

498
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,790
If you're at work, you
will be able to divert your mind.

499
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,120
But all this shit happened
because of my work.

500
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,370
Don't listen to these guys.

501
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,500
They're idiots,
chattering among themselves.

502
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,080
Whenever you feel alright, you can
join back. Okay? Take your time.

503
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,250
What do you mean?

504
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,580
Okay.

505
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,620
All right! Take your time,
but then, how much time?

506
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,500
Staying here all alone isn't going to
help. It will just end up driving you mad.

507
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,790
It's better for him if he
keeps himself busy, Tiwari.

508
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,790
The two guards…

509
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,080
I should have confronted
them as soon as we got there.

510
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,750
They didn't even look like guards.

511
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,120
My instinct kept telling
me that something's fishy.

512
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,870
Zoya and I even went back there…

513
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,540
but we had no evidence, and what
can you do without any evidence!

514
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,040
We decided to give them
the benefit of the doubt.

515
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,500
Motherfucking "benefit of the doubt!"

516
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,500
I should've just killed
them when I had the chance.

517
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,120
Milind! Milind!

518
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,200
It wasn't your fault.

519
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,580
Go tell Zoya that!

520
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,200
It wasn't her fault either!

521
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,040
It's all on me, it's all my failure, sir.
I've let you down, sir.

522
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,620
Did I ever tell you about Sujoy?

523
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,370
Remember?

524
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,950
Do you remember?

525
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
I did tell you.

526
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,080
Sujoy?

527
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,620
I was in Nagaland, in Kohima.

528
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,660
We had received intel
about an arms smuggler.

529
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,250
We wanted to nab him.

530
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,450
We were waiting outside the cafe.

531
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,290
But our asset, our informer…

532
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,870
didn't give us the signal.

533
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,000
We waited for an hour.

534
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,580
There was this one guy inside the cafe.

535
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,330
My instinct kept saying that
he's the guy we're after.

536
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:42,660
Before I could follow my instinct,
the smuggler figured out he's surrounded.

537
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,700
And he fired at us.

538
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,080
And Sujoy was shot dead… on the spot.

539
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,200
Fuck! When did this happen, boss?

540
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,830
Fuck!

541
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,580
After that incident… I felt so guilty.

542
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,620
I was miserable.

543
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,910
My kids were still very young, and
Suchi didn't know how to help me.

544
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,870
But one fine morning, Milind…

545
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,290
I woke up.

546
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,620
And I realized…

547
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,250
boss, this is the job.

548
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,370
And this is the risk.

549
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,040
We cannot sit and blame ourselves.

550
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,540
Milind, you put your life at risk
that day, which saved countless lives.

551
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,120
All of Delhi would have been annihilated.

552
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,540
Completely wiped out.

553
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,450
They would have been
choking on toxic gases.

554
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,410
Sir, then, why did you quit TASC?

555
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,450
Tiwari, you haven't changed.
You still have the touch.

556
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,700
What do you mean?

557
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,790
I mean, Sujoy.

558
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,330
What about Sujoy?

559
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,450
That Sujoy story wasn't made up?

560
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Fuck! Sorry, man. I didn't know.

561
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,290
You never told me about him.

562
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,700
You're fucking kidding me.
That actually happened? Damn!

563
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,250
Sir, the MLA, Mathivazhagan,
is here to see you.

564
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,410
Okay, sir.

565
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,040
Wait for me.

566
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,160
Subbu, my brother. How are you?

567
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,750
And how's Bhaskaran doing?

568
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,540
He's fine. How's your health?

569
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,450
Where do I even start!

570
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,410
They say that I have
BP, sugar, and whatnot.

571
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,500
And now, they say I have a small kidney
stone for which I'll need surgery.

572
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,910
But forget all that!

573
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,290
It's so good to see you
after such a long time.

574
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,790
It warms my heart.

575
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,790
Now, I finally feel like I am at peace.

576
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,330
Likewise,
it's great to see you after so long.

577
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,040
-Mathi.
-Yes?

578
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,750
Looks like I need your help again.

579
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,910
Please, don't use big words like "help!"

580
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Just tell me what you need,
and it'll be done!

581
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:39,000
Get some MLAs and MPs to talk favorably
about us to the Indian Government.

582
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,540
If India recognizes our
Government in Exile,

583
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,450
it will be a massive
victory for our cause.

584
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,750
Brother, I am not sure
how Delhi will react to this.

585
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,790
That woman… Basu?

586
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,000
She is so arrogant.

587
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,910
She doesn't like people like us!

588
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:08,450
The show she put on with
Rupatunga at the SAARC summit!

589
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,000
Unbelievable!

590
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,790
Brother, sorry!

591
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,250
I didn't intend to remind you
of Rupatunga and hurt you.

592
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,620
Forget all that.
I'll do what I can to rally support…

593
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,410
and bring this up for discussion
in the assembly, okay?

594
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,700
Long live Tamil!

595
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,700
Let's go.

596
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,910
Muthu Pandian.

597
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,290
Subbu is staying at that lodge.

598
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,910
You guys won't kill him, right?

599
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,080
You don't need to worry about all that.
We got this.

600
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,580
Thanks.

601
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,580
Sir, Subbu's identity has been confirmed.

602
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,500
-Do you have the team in place?
-Yes, sir!

603
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,580
How long will you take to
move in and pick up Subbu?

604
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,330
-One hour, sir.
-Go ahead!

605
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,450
I'll talk to the Mumbai TASC team,
and send you an officer-in-charge.

606
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,540
-Hand over Subbu to him.
-Yes, sir!

607
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,330
Make sure you keep this off the books.

608
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,540
No local cops to be involved.
Keep it low-key.

609
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
Yes, sir!

610
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,200
Subbu, how are you?

611
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,450
Everything all right?

612
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,660
Yes, I am doing fine here. Don't worry.

613
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,160
I have some good news.

614
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,540
Three people have agreed to talk
about our cause in the assembly.

615
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,290
An MP has even promised
to bring it up in the parliament.

616
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,410
It's a great start.

617
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,370
However, it isn't going to be that easy.

618
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,450
Anyway, when are you coming back?

619
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,290
I am meeting a couple more people
for funds and will leave tomorrow.

620
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,500
Be very careful.

621
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,000
Don't let that anger of yours
get the better of you, got it?

622
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,540
Up!

623
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,580
Who are you?

624
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,580
-Search the room.
-Yes, sir.

625
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,950
Check the suitcase.

626
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,540
What the hell is going on?
I am a Switzerland citizen!

627
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,450
You don't have the right to do this!

628
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,750
I am going to call the embassy!

629
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,120
Sir, we are just following orders.
I suggest you cooperate with us.

630
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,660
Let me make a call first!

631
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,620
I am not some average
Joe that you can fuck over.

632
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,700
We all know just who you are.

633
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,700
Okay.

634
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
You know what?
If you want to shoot me, go ahead…

635
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,620
-but I am getting out of here.
-Stay right there!

636
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,370
Brother, don't touch me again. Ever.

637
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,540
People have died just
for talking back to me.

638
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,790
Please, calm down.

639
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,830
Watch him.

640
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,790
Yes, sir.

641
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,410
You stay here.

642
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,750
Is everything okay, sir?

643
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,830
Oh! All good.
Thank you for your cooperation.

644
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,040
Some tea or coffee?

645
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,580
No, no. I am good. Thank you.

646
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,000
Let me know if you need anything.

647
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,830
Our agent from Mumbai
will be here any minute now.

648
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,500
Secure Subbu and bring him
to the back entrance.

649
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,870
Copy.

650
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,950
Get up.

651
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,410
Vasanth! Raghu! Come in! Vasanth?

652
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,830
Move! Go that side!

653
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,080
Cover all the exits!

654
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,830
Go that way!

655
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,000
You, this way!

656
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,040
Go.

657
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,160
I want him alive!

658
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,200
Subbu!

659
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,040
I want people on the second floor!

660
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,870
Secure the roof!

661
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,120
Ashok, check what happened!

662
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,080
What happened?

663
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,540
A man has fun and the world can't bear it.

664
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,330
-Take him to the hospital!
-Okay, sir.

665
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,830
Who's there?

666
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:10,160
Sir! Sir! It's not what you think, sir!

667
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,700
Sir, sir! We are a couple!
We are lovers, sir!

668
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,620
Sir! Sir!

669
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,290
Sir! It's my birthday today, sir!

670
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,370
Hey!

671
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,450
Shut up!

672
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,200
One more word and I will kill both of you.

673
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,750
Subbu!

674
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,540
Please don't harm the innocent civilians!

675
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,620
Asshole! I don't care!

676
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,450
One more word from you,
and people are going to die!

677
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,750
Subbu, there is no way you can escape!

678
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,370
Listen to what I am saying!

679
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,080
Phone.

680
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,200
-Can I make an international call?
-No, sir.

681
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,330
-Tiwari, I am busy!
-Just talk to me for a minute, fucker!

682
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,330
Talpade?

683
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,620
-Hi.
-Muthu Pandian.

684
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,620
JK.

685
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,370
What the hell is going on here?

686
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,910
We sent our team to bring
him to the back entrance.

687
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,120
He managed to overpower
us and killed our men.

688
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,580
You mean, an unarmed man
overpowered our trained agents?

689
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,790
Mr. JK, if you read the reports properly…

690
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,620
you'll know that Subramaniam
Palanivel isn't your average Joe.

691
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,160
-Listen, Mr. Muthuswamy--
-Muthu Pandian!

692
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,370
Yes, Muthu Pandian. Please understand,
our orders come directly from Delhi.

693
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,410
And we need to bring the situation
under control before it is too late.

694
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,790
I understand.

695
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,910
We've secured all the exits. Every
floor is manned by our personnel.

696
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,580
Just ensure that no civilian
enters the premises.

697
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,830
And the ones who are already inside,
keep them locked and secure.

698
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,750
Got that, boys?

699
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:03,410
And until I say so, nobody here
will use their weapon, alright?

700
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,700
Fucker thinks he's a big stud.
If you have any questions, ask!

701
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:08,790
What did you just say?

702
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,750
Merely translated what you just said.

703
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,040
But I said quite a bit?

704
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,750
Tamil is a precise language. Come.

705
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,120
What emergency do you have?

706
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,250
Listen, let's meet for lunch? My treat.

707
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,660
I am in Chennai.
In the middle of a hostage situation.

708
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,830
-What?
-I'll talk to you later.

709
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,160
Wait, wait, wait!
Tell me what's happening there.

710
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,200
We were supposed to take
a suspect to the safe house,

711
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,080
but that guy killed some of our men…

712
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,660
and is now cooped up
in a room with two hostages.

713
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,120
-Who's working with you?
-Local TASC officers.

714
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,250
And who's the subject?

715
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,660
I can't divulge the details to you!

716
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,750
You little fuck, just tell me!

717
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,290
Subramaniam Palanivel.

718
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,910
Do you remember the Sri Lankan rebels?

719
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,040
What the fu…

720
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,160
My sister is visiting us for Rakhi.

721
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,910
What nonsense are you talking about?

722
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,330
I don't have time for this shit!

723
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,580
Wait, listen!
Can't they call in the NSG for this?

724
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,540
No, we can't.

725
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,200
Kulkarni is very clear.
This operation is totally off the books.

726
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,080
There can be no leaks.

727
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,950
We have direct orders from Delhi.

728
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,080
I think, either the NSA
or PMO is involved.

729
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,000
Brad!

730
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,450
No, no! I'll be sending those TPS reports…

731
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,200
-What?
-to Andrews.

732
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,250
I'll also be changing the font color.

733
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,450
Yeah… back to blue.

734
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,080
And I'll be adding some colorful stuff!

735
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,450
What the fuck are you blabbering about?
Are you high?

736
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,370
My manager just stopped by.
Screw that, what were you saying?

737
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,580
The fucker, Subbu, refuses to negotiate.

738
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,750
I'll call you later, okay?

739
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,750
Don't call back! Enjoy the AC!

740
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,370
Bye, Talpade! Bye!

741
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,410
Weren't you just talking to Brad?

742
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,580
Yes, I was… and then, I switched the call.

743
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,200
So, personal call?

744
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,500
Sort of, semi-personal.

745
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,370
Remember, Srikant!
Don't be a "minimum guy."

746
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,250
Okay?

747
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,500
Good!

748
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,580
Yes?

749
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,200
Any update? Has Subbu made any demands?

750
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,750
Oh. I am so sorry, sir.

751
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,290
It completely slipped my mind
to give you hourly updates! Sorry!

752
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,750
Shove your sarcasm up your ass!

753
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,700
You're suffering from FOMO.

754
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,410
FOMO?

755
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,000
Fear of missing out, Uncle!

756
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,910
I am trying to help you.

757
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,410
I had an interesting idea
that I wanted to share with you.

758
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,370
But if you don't want it, that's fine!

759
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:46,160
FOMO, LOLO, ROFLO…
take it all up your ass.

760
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,290
JK! Just hear me out for a minute!

761
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,330
All right, tell me.

762
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,290
Chellam!

763
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:57,950
Who the hell is Chellam?

764
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,660
You don't know who Chellam is?

765
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,080
Can we play "Who wants to be
a millionaire" some other time?

766
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,950
I am in the middle of a hostage situation!

767
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,200
Chellam is the legendary agent…

768
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,000
who used to run missions in
Sri Lanka during the civil war.

769
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,790
And I think he is close
friends with Bhaskaran.

770
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,370
And our current RAW Chief
was mentored by Chellam.

771
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,000
Tell Sharma to call Chellam right away.
He's retired now, but that won't matter.

772
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,580
Are you serious?

773
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,330
No, I am making up stories
just to mess with you!

774
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:24,950
Just do as I say!

775
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,370
-Yes, JK. Tell me.
-Sir, we need help.

776
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,370
Srikant thinks that Chellam is
the key to negotiate with Subbu.

777
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:02,370
Srikant?

778
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,040
Sir, Srikant has offered to help.

779
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,000
Srikant?

780
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,250
Mr. Chellam! How are you?

781
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,040
Wrong number.

782
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,040
Yes, Srikant. Tell me.

783
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,500
You are the most cautious
man on the planet.

784
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,830
You're back? I was wondering
when I'd get a call.

785
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,910
Just didn't expect it would be you.

786
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,870
Srikant!

787
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:05,410
Well… yes.
I don't quite know what to say, sir.

788
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,750
You must be aware that, you know, there's
a hostage situation in Chennai, sir.

789
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,830
Yes, I know.

790
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,870
That Subbu situation
has gotten out of hand.

791
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,660
Yes, sir. And we need your help.

792
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,620
I am a retired old man.
What help can I offer?

793
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,290
And why are you getting involved?
Didn't you retire?

794
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,750
Yes, I did. Same as you, sir.

795
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,580
But these are exceptional circumstances,
and we need your help.

796
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,410
Tell me, how can I help?

797
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,910
Sir, you'll have to speak
to Subbu's brother, Bhaskaran.

798
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,580
I know he will listen to you.

799
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:52,950
Mr. Chellam!

800
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,870
Listen to me carefully.

801
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,290
-Hello?
-Hand the phone to Subbu.

802
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,620
Tell him his brother,
Bhaskaran, wants to talk.

803
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,790
Bhaskaran wants to talk to his brother.

804
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,620
Subbu! Your brother, Bhaskaran,
wants to talk to you!

805
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,700
I am leaving my gun
here and coming to you.

806
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,080
Don't play games!

807
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,290
Trust me! Please, talk to your brother!

808
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,000
I am approaching you.

809
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,120
I am unarmed!

810
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,080
Don't shoot!

811
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,620
Hello? Brother?

812
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:17,830
Subbu… listen to me carefully.

813
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:20,040
These bastards tried to arrest me.

814
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,200
-I want to kill all of--
-Subbu!

815
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,120
Shut up and listen to me, okay?

816
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,750
Okay.

817
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,290
Surrender.

818
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:34,750
Brother!

819
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,450
Are you nuts?

820
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,540
I'd rather die!

821
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,500
Subbu… don't do anything stupid.

822
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,750
-I don't have a good feeling about this.
-Subbu.

823
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,290
Just do as I say.

824
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,790
Out, out, out!

825
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,410
Hope that was a good catch-up.

826
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,790
Now, give me the phone.

827
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,120
Oh, shit!

828
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,750
Motherfucker!

829
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,450
Talk to the traffic police,
and clear our routes.

830
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,620
Sharma is going to shit on me.

831
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,120
It was supposed to be simple and brief,
but it turned out to be a nightmare.

832
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,450
It has only begun.

833
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,000
Since he has killed officers, they
have taken him into judicial custody.

834
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,660
TASC will have to apply for his custody.

835
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,120
Fucking asshole!

836
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,750
Why did he have to break my phone!

837
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,700
Our sources in Chennai tell us
that Sri Lankan rebel leader…

838
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,620
Subramaniam Palanivel is now under arrest.

839
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,750
Subbu is the younger brother of
Bhaskaran, who is a former rebel leader,

840
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:17,330
and is currently the Head of
the Sri Lankan Government in Exile.

841
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,000
A Home Ministry representative
has revealed that…

842
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,290
PM Basu is monitoring
the situation closely.

843
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,870
However, no official statement has
been released about Subbu's arrest.

844
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,910
Why do you look so happy?

845
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,370
That's because today,
I have outdone myself.

846
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,450
Whom did you shoot?

847
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,450
Are you crazy?

848
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,790
When will you give me a gun?

849
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,200
Why the hell do you want a gun?

850
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,700
Why not? I'll also need
a silencer, so that--

851
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,120
Get me one with a silencer,
so that no one finds out.

852
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,040
Do you know what the world's
most powerful weapon is?

853
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:00,910
What is it?

854
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,120
Brains. Right here.

855
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,750
Where is Dhriti?

856
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,120
Use your world's most powerful
weapon and find out where Dhriti is.

857
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:24,500
Listen, stop here.
I'll walk home from here.

858
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,580
Sure.

859
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,500
-Bye, Kalyan.
-Bye, Dhriti.

860
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:49,080
ALL OKAY?

861
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:52,950
YES, JUST DROPPED HER OFF AT HOME.
