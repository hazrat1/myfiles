1
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,000
Help!

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,660
Please, help!

3
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,370
Help!

4
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,000
Help! Somebody help!

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,830
Help!

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,620
Help!

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,790
Mom!

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,040
You bastard!

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,950
Why are you doing this? Please, tell me.

10
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,620
Here's some food. Eat.

11
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,410
-Leave me!
-Hey!

12
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,160
Eat!

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,830
Hey!

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,410
Enough is enough!

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,540
I trusted you, Kalyan.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,120
Please, let me go. Please, I beg of you!

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
Please, Kalyan. Please, I want
to go back to my mom-dad. Please!

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,500
-It is not in my hands.
-Please!

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,910
I just do what they ask me to do.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,870
What?

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,200
Who are they?

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,330
Have you lost it?

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,540
There's no point in screaming.

24
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,750
Nobody can hear you.

25
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,870
My father doesn't have
much money to pay you.

26
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,160
You are here because of
your father, understood?

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,450
What?

28
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,080
All Srikant Tiwari has ever
done is kill innocent people

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,830
in the name of the country!

30
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,250
That's all!

31
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,750
What the hell are you talking about?

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,160
My father is a normal guy!

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,080
Normal guys don't work for the NIA.

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,830
-N-I what?
-Your father is a secret agent!

35
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,330
He works for infidels
and takes innocent lives!

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,910
And to all my brothers, he's been a--

37
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,620
There has been a misunderstanding.

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,790
My father works for an IT company.

39
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,370
He's a normal guy!

40
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,450
This is all a big mistake!

41
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,120
Kalyan, please!

42
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,410
Is your name even Kalyan?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Who are you?

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,830
Kidnapper?

45
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,830
Gangster?

46
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,540
Go on.

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,080
Terrorist?

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,870
That's how all of you see us, right?

49
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,250
Eat.

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,160
You are going to be here for a while.

51
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,830
Yes, Atharv just ate.
He's about to leave for school.

52
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,870
I don't know…

53
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,500
how can a mother not know
where her daughter is?

54
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,000
Dad, please listen to what I am saying.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
How am I supposed to know?

56
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,620
She said she was going
to the mall with Mahima!

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,290
Mahima says she has no idea!

58
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,250
What I am trying to say is…

59
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,750
I am sorry, Dad. I am sorry.

60
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,830
I will call you once she's back home.

61
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,200
Her name is Raji. She is a trained pilot.

62
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,790
Selvarasan studied aviation
engineering in Ireland.

63
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,540
So, you think they are
planning an air attack?

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,160
Pretty sure. Especially, since
Raji and Selva are involved.

65
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,450
A plane packed with all the C4 they stole

66
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,750
from Point Pedro is like a guided missile.

67
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,000
We have to send a high alert signal
to all the airports immediately.

68
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,950
Besides Meenambakam Airport, I want
a list of all the private airstrips…

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,830
and flying schools in the nearby vicinity.
I want it right now! Immediately!

70
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,750
On it, sir.

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,410
How is Suchi doing?

72
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,620
She is… she's trying to be strong.

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,870
I can't believe Dhriti has a boyfriend.

74
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,620
We don't even realize when kids grow up.

75
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,000
Tiwari, I should have been
there with you right now.

76
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,370
If only--

77
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,080
Deep down, I knew my job would
have repercussions on my family.

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,700
I am sure that has happened.

79
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,410
What's the update there?

80
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,290
New intel suggests that the rebels
are planning a kamikaze-style attack.

81
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,200
Shit!

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,200
Have you put the DGCA
and Air Force in the loop?

83
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,950
Tiwari, stop worrying about what's
happening here. I will handle it.

84
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,950
You just focus on Dhriti.

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,660
I am sure she will be home soon.

86
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,410
Okay then, bye.

87
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,290
Srikant.

88
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,620
What happened?

89
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,540
I am so sorry about all this.

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,000
Seriously, if you need anything
at all, please let me know.

91
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,700
That's alright. Thank you.

92
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Thanks.

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,910
Bye.

94
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,830
Bye, Suchi.

95
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,290
When was the last time you met Dhriti?

96
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,250
We went to the inter-school
culturals, two weeks back.

97
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,660
How was Dhriti then?

98
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,000
I mean, well, she was just being Dhriti.

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,330
She fought with the
judges and called them…

100
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,000
sexist assholes.

101
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,700
She was like a sister to me, Uncle.

102
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,500
So, we never really spoke to each other.

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,200
She doesn't like people from the town.

104
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,330
She called me a capitalist baboon.

105
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,250
-What?
-Capitalist baboon?

106
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,910
Dhriti and I, we developed
some ideological differences.

107
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,250
So, we weren't really that tight.

108
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,580
She's a feminazi and I am a libertarian.

109
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,200
I am more old-style.

110
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,540
What is this feminazi?

111
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,370
It was Kalyan's birthday yesterday,
so they went to a movie…

112
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,290
at Infinity.

113
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,330
After that, they went over to his house.

114
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,500
Is Kalyan here at school?

115
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,040
He's not from our school, Uncle.

116
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,830
-Which school is he from?
-I don't know.

117
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,870
-What do you mean?
-I mean, he looks older, so…

118
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,580
Do you happen to have his photograph?

119
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,500
No.

120
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,870
Actually, when I tried taking
a selfie with him, he didn't let me.

121
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,790
-Why?
-He is kind of shy, I think.

122
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,120
I don't know!

123
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, what is his phone like?

124
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,040
Phone?

125
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,410
It's one of those old-style,
non-touch, keypad phones.

126
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,450
Okay, Mahima!

127
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,750
You know right,

128
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,950
that Kalyan and Dhriti were…

129
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,450
What, Uncle?

130
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Excuse me, ma'am.
Can you just give us two minutes?

131
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,000
Thank you, ma'am.

132
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,200
Is it right that Dhriti and Kalyan
are girlfriend and boyfriend?

133
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,330
Is that a bad thing, Uncle?

134
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,250
No!

135
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,160
Everyone has a boyfriend,
all the girls in our class.

136
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,910
I mean, except me, of course.

137
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,660
Look, Mahima. If there is anything
else that you know about Dhriti…

138
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,660
then please, tell me.

139
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,040
If there is any secret between you
two, please tell me.

140
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,450
It is a very serious situation!

141
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,790
We can't find Dhriti!

142
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,700
Uncle, I have told you everything.

143
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,540
So, how did Dhriti and Kalyan meet?

144
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,370
Dhriti met him on Instagram, I think.

145
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,450
He has deleted his account.

146
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,330
This guy is a ghost.

147
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,660
Sri, I think, it's time for
you to tell Suchi about everything.

148
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,080
What?

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,790
That Dhriti has been kidnapped?

150
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,540
I have spoken to the airport authorities.

151
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,200
They've mailed me the list
of students and staff

152
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,870
from the Chennai Airport Flying Club.

153
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,080
And?

154
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Dead-end.

155
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,660
But the AIA guy said there is
an independent flying school

156
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,160
on the Chennai-Bangalore highway.

157
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,700
-Tigris Aviation.
-Okay.

158
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,660
But it has been shut for a few months now.

159
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,080
Have you contacted Tigris Aviation?

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,910
The number is dead.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,950
Should we go and check?

162
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,290
Sure, let's go!

163
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,000
Fucking hell!
Won't even let me eat in peace!

164
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,040
Sir, this way.

165
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,950
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

166
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Yes, show me.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,370
Skip ahead.

168
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,370
Pause it! Pause it!

169
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,500
-Zoom in.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,410
Wait a second.

171
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,750
-Alright.
-Play on.

172
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,410
Show me where he exited from.

173
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,410
Yes.

174
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,330
Shit!

175
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,370
Why the long face?

176
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,910
Can you do it or not?

177
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,290
Yes, I can.

178
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,660
I have to shoot a video of you.

179
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,450
Need to see you cry.

180
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,790
If it hurts, then…

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,040
Please!

182
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,830
Please, don't hurt me.

183
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,660
I will just act it out.

184
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,790
Start recording.

185
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,620
Srikant Tiwari, do as you are told.

186
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,910
Fuck off!

187
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,410
Raji! Those bastards have come here, too!

188
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,790
Open the gate.

189
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,200
Sir, the company has shut down.

190
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,370
We are with the police. Open the gate.

191
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,660
Raji!

192
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,290
The car is coming in.

193
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,660
Are you going to open the gate
or someone else will do it?

194
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,160
Sir, what do you want?

195
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,290
Are you in charge here?

196
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,830
No, I am not.

197
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,370
I am just here to salvage the equipment.

198
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,500
I am not allowed to entertain
visitors without proper authorization.

199
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,080
We are the police department!
What other authorization do you need?

200
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,000
Fuck off!

201
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,330
Muthu, you check the plane.
I will see what's going on inside.

202
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,870
Sir, sir!

203
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,660
Sorry, but I can't let you check
the premises without permission.

204
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,700
What permission?

205
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,040
You are stopping a law enforcement
officer from doing his duty!

206
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
This investigation
concerns national security.

207
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,120
-In Tamil?
-Muthu, explain it to him, please.

208
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,160
So, you are impeding an investigation
that concerns national security.

209
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,450
-Out of the way!
-Sorry, sir. I can't let you.

210
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,580
Without permission we cannot
allow you inside, sir.

211
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,200
We should have come here with a warrant.

212
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,040
We did not come here planning to raid it.

213
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,950
What does it matter anymore? We need
a warrant if we have to do any inspection.

214
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,660
You both go…

215
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,540
and get a search warrant
from the magistrate.

216
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,500
-Okay, sir.
-What?

217
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,660
-Okay, sir.
-I will talk to him over the phone.

218
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,620
Leave now.

219
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,330
Until the warrant comes,

220
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,750
they will be here only.

221
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,330
Tell this guy that I want to see all
the company permits, DGCA license with…

222
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,870
the certificate of incorporation.

223
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,000
Also, we need a list of all the people
who have been trained here.

224
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,500
-Show us the documents?
-License… document…

225
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,750
you can examine that, but I can't let you
search the premises without a warrant.

226
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,910
Where is everyone else?

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,040
He is salvaging all the
equipment by himself?

228
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,160
Where are the others?

229
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,200
Are you here to salvage
the equipment all by yourself?

230
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,790
I came here to survey the place.

231
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,830
He is here to survey.

232
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,290
Prabhu!

233
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,040
What is going on? Who are these people?

234
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,410
Sir, they are with the police.

235
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,700
Sir, there is nothing here.

236
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,450
In a few days, they will pull down this
hangar, too. The company has shut down.

237
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,450
Muthu, let us--

238
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,000
-What is your name?
-Karthik.

239
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,160
Where are you from?

240
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,000
-Trichy.
-He is our manager, sir.

241
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,160
No need for a warrant.
Just get permission from the owner.

242
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,620
Also, before you leave, please log
your visit in the visitor's book.

243
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,450
Sign in the visitor's book?
Do I look like a fucking tourist to you?

244
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,250
How long will you guys be here?

245
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,580
We will leave in a bit,
once we take the equipment.

246
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,620
Muthu! Muthu!

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,250
Don't fight.

248
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,620
Come here.

249
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,370
Let's think of some other way.

250
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,290
-Just one thing.
-What?

251
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,410
The manager…

252
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,910
when he first spoke…

253
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,040
it sounded like he was
talking in Sri Lankan Tamil.

254
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,250
Are you sure?

255
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,620
He was talking with a Jaffna accent.

256
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,750
"What's going on? Who are these people?"

257
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,370
Nobody speaks like that in Tamil Nadu.

258
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,790
Srikant, I have alerted all units, and
they are actively searching for Dhriti.

259
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,790
We will find her.

260
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,950
What is this?

261
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,540
Give it to me.

262
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,870
Give it to me.

263
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,790
Srikant Tiwari, do as you are told.

264
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,200
I--

265
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,750
What do they want with our daughter?

266
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,660
-Suchi, calm down. Calm down.
-I just want Dhriti back!

267
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,790
-She will be back!
-I just want her back!

268
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,160
Suchi! Su--

269
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,450
We can't let them stay here for too long.

270
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,120
We have to get rid of them immediately.

271
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,830
Man! It's almost nighttime.

272
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,620
When will the warrant get here?

273
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,540
I'd told you it will take time.

274
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,950
Sir, I am leaving. You should too.
Come back tomorrow.

275
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,080
The warrant is on the way.

276
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,250
Once it is here, we will take half an
hour to search the place, so just wait.

277
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,950
-I can't. I have to go. Prabhu!
-Sir!

278
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
He will be here.

279
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,000
What did he say?

280
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,080
That one is going, this one will wait.

281
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,700
We have to wait, too. Fucking hell!

282
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,910
-Hello?
-Srikant Tiwari.

283
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,080
Oh, Sajid Ghani.

284
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,910
You have started kidnapping
children to achieve your goals?

285
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,750
Did you forget how you manipulated
Moosa's mother to achieve your goal?

286
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,370
You and I are the same.

287
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,410
We are both willing to do whatever
it takes to get what we want.

288
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,200
What do you want?

289
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,040
If you want your daughter back alive…

290
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,200
then you and your team need
to stay out of my way.

291
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,660
I want to talk to my daughter.

292
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,750
Srikant, if I were in your place…

293
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,500
I wouldn't play these games.

294
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,620
Hey!

295
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,870
I am not playing any games!

296
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,660
This is a matter of my daughter's life.

297
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,200
I just want to know if
she is alright, got it?

298
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,120
Eight o'clock.

299
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,830
He's using a scrambler.

300
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,120
Sorry.

301
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,580
Muthu!

302
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,580
You try to distract him.

303
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,040
-I will try to look around.
-What?

304
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,620
We can't wait any longer!

305
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,290
What did you say your name was?

306
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,200
Prabhu.

307
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,580
Prabhu.

308
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,700
Where are you from?

309
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,120
Madurai, sir.

310
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,370
-From proper Madurai?
-Yes.

311
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,250
Oh, you came here from Madurai?

312
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,830
Yes, sir. Now, I am in Chennai.

313
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,910
Chennai?

314
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Where in Chennai?

315
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,040
Kundrathur.

316
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,160
Oh, okay. What is this, Prabhu?

317
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,200
It would have taken us only ten minutes.

318
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,040
We would have finished our job and left.

319
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,080
Okay, forget it.

320
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,540
Okay, is there a tea shop nearby?

321
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
I have no idea, sir.
I think, it's a little far.

322
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,500
I just came here to survey, sir.

323
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,790
Fuck!

324
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,620
Shit! Shit!

325
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,750
Muthu!

326
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,700
JK!

327
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,410
Brother, shoot.

328
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
Careful!

329
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,290
They are running away!

330
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,910
The entire plane is
packed with explosives!

331
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,250
What?

332
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,830
Listen!

333
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,330
You go towards the fence and try
to escape. I will cover for you.

334
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,750
Let's go together.

335
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,040
Damn it! If we don't split up,
we will both die.

336
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,450
Go!

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Hurry up, Muthu!

338
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,160
Hey, look over there.

339
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,410
Look, he is running!

340
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,950
Over there! He is getting away! Shoot him!

341
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,750
Hey! They are getting away!

342
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,370
Fuckers! I can't find them!

343
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,700
They have escaped!

344
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,580
Let's pack up and leave
before they return with backup.

345
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,290
Srikant, it's already 8:15 p.m.
They haven't called yet.

346
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,200
-They were supposed to call
-Suchi,

347
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,290
-15 minutes ago!
-Suchi, Suchi!

348
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,330
This is a usual tactic.

349
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,700
They just do it to make
the family anxious.

350
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,120
Don't worry, they will call.

351
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,370
Wait.

352
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,830
Hello?

353
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,250
Mom, I love you.

354
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,870
I am sorry about what I
said to you the other day.

355
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,790
I am really sorry, I didn't mean it.

356
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,160
It's okay, little one.

357
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,830
Are you okay?

358
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,870
Are you hurt?

359
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,620
I am okay.

360
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,870
-Dhriti!
-Dad!

361
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,040
Listen to me, okay? Pay attention.

362
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,040
I am listening, Dad.

363
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,330
Okay… Dhriti.

364
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,540
First of all, my child…

365
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,790
I love you, okay?

366
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,120
And…

367
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,080
I won't let anything happen to you.

368
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,750
I promise you, I will bring you back.

369
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,500
I hope Kalyan didn't hurt you.

370
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,410
No, Dad. He did not.

371
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,450
Is Kalyan with you?

372
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,500
-Yeah.
-Kalyan, my son.

373
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,870
If you can hear me, then tell
me, do you really love Dhriti?

374
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,250
What are you saying?

375
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,290
Or was your love for her
only an act, to kidnap her?

376
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,580
Dad, what are you saying?

377
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,540
Kalyan, I don't know
what your real name is,

378
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,410
but I know this much…

379
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,330
that if you love Dhriti…

380
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,830
then you won't let anything happen to her.

381
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,790
Dad, what are you even saying?

382
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,910
Dhriti!

383
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,870
Dhriti, listen to me carefully.

384
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,410
Man can truly feel alive only if
he finds a true connection in life.

385
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,830
Connection, my child.

386
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,370
The true meaning of life is only felt…

387
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,870
through ties of love.

388
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,500
Love is the only strength,
and only weakness, dear.

389
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,250
Do you understand what I am saying?

390
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,450
Love is a strength, but also a weakness.

391
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,370
Dad--

392
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
We have got nothing.

393
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,200
They are using Dhriti as leverage.

394
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,080
So that I do what they want me to do.

395
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,200
Well, go ahead.

396
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,790
Do it!

397
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,370
She is paying for your deeds.

398
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,580
I don't care what you do
and how you do it…

399
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,660
but I want my daughter back!

400
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,160
You get it?

401
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,410
Motherfucker!

402
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,950
-Yes, brother.
-Is Salman with you?

403
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,660
-Yes.
-Put me on speaker.

404
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,120
-Listen carefully.
-Yes, brother.

405
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,660
I will be there soon.
Syed, meet me on the highway.

406
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,200
Salman, get the camera ready.
Make sure the battery is fully charged.

407
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,790
I want to record her
screams before we kill her.

408
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,910
Get everything ready.

409
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,580
The video should make that
motherfucker want to kill himself.

410
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,450
Hang up.

411
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,790
Sri… RPF called. They have sent a video.

412
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,410
Show me.

413
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,160
This is from Dombivli station.

414
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,870
11:30 p.m., last night.

415
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,160
Here, look at this.

416
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,500
He dumped Dhriti's phone on the train…

417
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,620
and then, the phone traveled up
and down the line.

418
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,040
The fucker has used his brains well.

419
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,000
Check all the footage from the station's
surveillance cameras and traffic cameras.

420
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,580
And ask the Dombivli police station
to start their search immediately.

421
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,000
-Ajit, you come with me. Come on!
-Come, come! Come on, guys!

422
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,290
Have you seen this man?

423
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,410
No, sir.

424
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,830
Have you seen him somewhere?

425
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,700
-No, I haven't.
-Have you seen this man?

426
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,620
No.

427
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,000
Hello. Jeep 635?

428
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,120
Hello! Sub-Inspector Shinde here.

429
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,660
We are sending you pictures.
If you spot this man, be vigilant.

430
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,450
-And inform the headquarters immediately.
-Okay, okay. Copy, copy.

431
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,830
I will inform you immediately.

432
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,950
Over.

433
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,410
Head towards the station.

434
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,410
Looks like a couple of junkies.

435
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,830
Arrest them.

436
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,660
What's going on here?

437
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,410
Nothing, sir. Just smoking a cigarette.

438
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
-Cigarette?
-Yes, sir. Just smoking a cigarette.

439
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,250
Junkie asshole!

440
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,500
Put them in the car!

441
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,410
-Sir, we weren't doing anything.
-Shut up and get in the car!

442
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,080
What is this, sir?
I have never been arrested for this!

443
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,330
Yeah, let us go.
Looks like it is your lucky day.

444
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,620
I will give you a nice tip.

445
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,830
Please, leave us.

446
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,540
You want to go home, right?

447
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,410
Give me some information
and I will let you.

448
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,250
Have you seen this man?

449
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,620
Sir, I have seen him.

450
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,750
Where?

451
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,040
In Dombivli.

452
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,290
I know where he lives.

453
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,580
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

454
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,080
Jeep 635, connect me to the headquarters!

455
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,200
So, it was all a lie?

456
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,660
-Yes, brother.
-Sajid and I are on the way.

457
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,250
Is everything set?

458
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,620
Yes, everything is ready.

459
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,040
Are you going to kill me?

460
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,160
I know you are going to kill me.

461
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,200
Please, please, let me go.

462
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,750
Please! Please, don't kill me!

463
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,040
-Let go of my hand.
-No, Kalyan. Please!

464
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,950
I am sorry, it's not in my hands.

465
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,290
Kalyan, please.
Dad was right that you love me.

466
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,580
I know you do.

467
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,750
Please!

468
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,580
Please! I swear,
I won't say anything to anybody!

469
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,790
Please, let me go!

470
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,410
Please! I swear on you, Kalyan!

471
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,120
Please!

472
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,410
I don't want to die.

473
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,500
I know somewhere you love me, too.

474
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,580
For a… for a second, please…

475
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,580
please untie me!

476
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,160
Please, Kalyan!

477
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,580
Let us leave from here.

478
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,950
You come with me.

479
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,250
Please!

480
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,160
Kalyan, please.

481
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,410
Thank you!

482
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,370
Thank you so much!

483
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,540
I knew you will let me go.

484
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,500
Please, drop me off at home.

485
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,120
I am sorry.

486
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,080
I can't let you go.

487
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,080
I am sorry, I can't!

488
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,910
Kalyan, no.

489
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,200
Please, I don't want to die.

490
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,750
He will kill me, Kalyan! Please!

491
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,580
Kalyan, please!
