1
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,540
Krishnamurthy, the forensic team
is on the way. Follow up with them.

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,450
Okay, madam.

3
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,410
What are these jokers up to?

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,580
They both are jobless fellows, madam.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,580
Madam, listen to me!

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,750
Look, my name is Srikant Tiwari.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,580
We are here on an official visit.

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,950
Please! We have to make a call!

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,500
First, answer my question.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,950
Why did you murder Nanda?

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,910
Murder?

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,660
-We look like murderers to you?
-Calm down.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,750
-She called us murderers!
-Just shut up! Let me deal with it!

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,330
First, let me deal with this.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,830
-What were you doing with the body?
-Nothing!

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,330
We didn't do anything… with… with… body!

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,950
What we'll do we with the body?

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,160
-Removing evidence!
-Evidence? What evidence?

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,580
-We didn't know there was a body!
-Just calm down, please!

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,290
-But what bo--
-Hey! Calm down!

21
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,910
Madam, madam. No, no.
You are getting us all wrong.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,330
We are government agents, madam.

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,910
-Which department?
-TASC!

24
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,540
-Threat Analysis and Surveillance--
-I don't know any TASC!

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,910
-Don't tell her all this!
-But--

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,000
Because it is a top secret.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,370
Good joke.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,250
Tell this to the magistrate.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
Joke? You think this is a joke?
You jokers!

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,330
-What are you--
-What did you say?

31
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,040
-Madam!
-I am calling you, "jokers!"

32
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,540
Everybody!

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,870
Show them who the jokers are!

34
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,580
-Dude, she's mad!
-Mad?

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,580
You're being an idiot! The angrier
you get, the angrier she gets!

36
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,540
"Bhadwa"?

37
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,830
Are you cursing me out in Hindi?

38
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,620
-No, no!
-You want to see what I can do?

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,080
This isn't a cussword!

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,410
I said if you get angry,
she will get more angry!

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,580
"Bhadakegi" is not a cussword!

42
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,660
"Bhadwa" is the cussword, madam!

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,580
"Bhadwa" is the cussword.

44
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,410
-What are you doing, man?
-What are they blabbering in Hindi?

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,790
Stop screaming at her!
You don't understand women,

46
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,910
that's why you're single! You got it?

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
As if you're an expert.

48
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,540
-Miss Umiyal!
-Umayal!

49
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,830
Yeah, whatever! I need-- I want phone…

50
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,450
I want to make a call.

51
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,830
It is my right.

52
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,750
Madam, please. We need to make a call.

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,700
-We need to.
-Okay. One call!

54
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,000
What is the number?

55
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,790
-Who remembers numbers!
-No, no. I--

56
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,700
It is on my phone.

57
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,500
Please! Please, madam! Please!

58
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,950
Saw how she got it when I
started speaking in legal terms--

59
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,660
-Name?
-Yes, type.

60
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,410
B-H-O-S-D-K.

61
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,450
Calling Sharma?

62
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,450
"Bose DK"?

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,750
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

64
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,080
You two think this is a game?

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,080
-What?
-What?

66
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
"You two"?

67
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,830
What happened to her now?

68
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,500
Hello? Where is she taking my phone?

69
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,700
No, no, no!

70
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,290
Fucking hell! Motherfucker!

71
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,040
You will spend the night in jail!

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Happy now?

73
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,870
If you'd listened to me, we
would have sorted everything out by now.

74
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,750
We're here because
of you in the first place!

75
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,660
Because of me? Are you kidding me!

76
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,540
That's right!
Why couldn't you control her?

77
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,870
-When didn't I try to control her?
-She fucked up my phone!

78
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,450
I still have to pay the EMIs for it
for the next six months!

79
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,200
You really are uncaring and selfish!
Suchi is absolutely right!

80
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,120
-I swear.
-Why are you dragging Suchi into this?

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Why shouldn't I?

82
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,120
-Why did you have to bring her up?
-Because she's absolutely right about you!

83
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,750
I'll kill you if you
bring Suchi into this!

84
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,160
-And I will keep quiet!
-Hey! Hey!

85
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,950
-Why are you making so much noise?
-Listen to me, you…

86
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,870
Krishnamurthy,
put that shorty in the other cell!

87
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,700
-Show me what you've got, you little fuck!
-You bet I'll show you, asshole!

88
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,410
-I'll fuck you up!
-I'd like to see you try!

89
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,580
Go to that cell!

90
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,500
-Don't you dare touch me!
-Hey! Get lost!

91
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,830
I'll show you who's the boss!

92
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,330
And you call yourself an officer?
Nonsense!

93
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,200
You don't even believe us
that we are officers!

94
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,250
Shut up!

95
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,950
So, she does speak Hindi!

96
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,830
Then, why the hell was I trying
to talk in English! It was all an act!

97
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,790
You!

98
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
What's the payload?

99
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
Approximately, 400 kilos.

100
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,910
The takeoff load for
this plane is 500 kilos.

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,040
Get rid of all the seats,
except the pilot's seat.

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,910
And switch to lightweight tires.

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
How much does the pilot weigh?

104
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,750
Raji.

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
Raji, you're early.

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Is everything okay?

107
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,750
There was a problem.

108
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,120
The police are looking for me.

109
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,620
What? Police!

110
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,580
Do they know about the mission?

111
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,040
I told you to keep a low profile!

112
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,290
You of all people are
aware of what's at stake!

113
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,200
Were you followed?

114
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,200
No, I wasn't followed, and nobody
knows anything about the mission.

115
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,910
Don't worry, I took care of it.

116
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,660
Okay.

117
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,950
Go, freshen up. Then, we'll talk.

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,580
Fuck!

119
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200
Bloody hell!

120
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,290
What happened?

121
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,870
My back is fucked!

122
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,040
-Try the cobra pose.
-What?

123
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,580
Do yoga now and then.

124
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,160
You've started to look like a constable.

125
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,700
Don't rub salt on my wound.
Just tell me what to do.

126
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,700
Look up at the ceiling.

127
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,500
You okay?

128
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,290
Then, exhale as you come back down.

129
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,950
But from where? My nose or my mouth?

130
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,660
From wherever the hell you can.

131
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,620
Hey! Tea!

132
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,080
-Brother, how about some tea?
-Stop calling him your brother.

133
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,410
They threw us in for a night. All the
big brothers will shove a bamboo up yours.

134
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,910
This guy looks like he's ready for it.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,830
Hey, Muthu is here.

136
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,450
Come on, get up!

137
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,620
-Muthu!
-Andrew, open it!

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,500
-Okay, madam.
-One phone call and I can have you fired.

139
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,410
Sorry, sir.

140
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
-Open this one, too!
-What the hell were you thinking?

141
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,410
-Sorry, sir. I didn't realize--
-What rubbish!

142
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,830
-Are you out of your mind?
-It's alright.

143
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,000
They told you so many
times, but even then, you--

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,290
I said it's alright.
It's just a misunderstanding, right?

145
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,200
But…

146
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,000
you know, madam,
you should have let us call.

147
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,040
I am so sorry, sir.

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,450
Do you know, that was a rebel house!
That house… rebel house!

149
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,000
That house belonged to this girl, Raji.

150
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,160
Who?

151
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,160
This girl.

152
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,410
Where have I seen her?

153
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,450
Yeah, I think, I've seen this girl.

154
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,700
JK! Isn't she the one, who we…

155
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,080
-Yes! On the road--
-we met her in that alley!

156
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
-Yes! Yes!
-What?

157
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,040
She could be a rebel operative!

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,790
Let me cross-check this
with our database, wait.

159
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,540
-Sir!
-Oh, thank you.

160
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,620
My phone!

161
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,330
Put this in rice for 24 hours.
It will work.

162
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,790
Will it really work?

163
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,200
-Fifty percent chance, it might.
-Fifty percent!

164
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,870
I am so sorry, sir.

165
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,950
It's okay. Just call me JK.

166
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay, JK Sir.

167
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,370
Just JK.

168
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,750
Shall we?

169
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,700
JK!

170
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,200
Hello? Yes, sir!

171
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,370
You are wasting your time.

172
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,540
That which I sent you,
check and let me know.

173
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,250
-Rice, right?
-Yeah.

174
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,370
Brother, I need to know immediately.

175
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,250
You know,
more than building a features' list,

176
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,540
I think we need to crack
that one everyday problem

177
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,200
this app can solve for the users.

178
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,410
You know, a recent survey
on workplace stress

179
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,950
reveals that the worst
period for corporate workers is…

180
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,250
during the appraisal time.

181
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,620
So, if this app can send a subtle message…

182
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,950
it can help the workers

183
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,500
during this stressful time,
I think that'll be great.

184
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,790
-Alright.
-Yeah?

185
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,750
Can I get a mock-up ready by tomorrow?

186
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,450
Ma'am, there are many changes,
so it'll take some time.

187
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,410
Abdul, I am not asking for details.
It's just a mock-up for the client.

188
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,830
I'll get it done by tomorrow, don't worry.

189
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,910
Thanks, Gunjan.

190
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,750
I think, we should take Abdul
as the test subject for our app.

191
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,660
I really get the feeling that
he's going through some shit.

192
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,750
By the way, how are Atharv and Dhriti?

193
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,040
They're fine. You know, young adults.

194
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,870
And… Srikant?

195
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,160
Has he gotten used to corporate life?

196
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,500
He's in Chennai.

197
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,040
You know, let me work on this.
I'll email it to you.

198
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,660
So… I'll wait for your email.

199
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,200
You can switch on or off
instantly, can't you?

200
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Arvind!

201
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,330
I told you long back that the reason
I joined this company…

202
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,950
was, so that I don't lose my sanity.

203
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,500
And… I'd even said--

204
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,910
Don't take me wrong, Suchi.

205
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,200
You know what? We're friends.

206
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,830
And to act all formal, as colleagues…

207
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,040
We've spent so much time together.

208
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,950
Arvind!

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,080
Don't you see?
That's where the problems started!

210
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,290
Suchi, all I want to say is that…

211
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,540
-you don't have to be a stranger.
-What other way is there, Arvind?

212
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,660
You know that chapter
of my life is closed.

213
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,540
I don't want to open that book ever again.

214
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,160
-And if you're expecting that--
-You know what… let it be.

215
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,250
Do your thing.

216
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,950
I am angry with you, Papa!

217
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,580
Why? What's the matter?

218
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,250
You haven't had any time
to call for two days!

219
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,410
You really forgot us!

220
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,000
Are you mad?

221
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,000
I have a really bad network at the hotel.

222
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,290
-You didn't go to school?
-It's a bank holiday today.

223
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,870
What does a bank holiday
have to do with school?

224
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,200
That's just the way things are.
It's complicated.

225
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,830
Okay, listen!
Order me a pizza online, please.

226
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,750
How's Suchi?

227
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,330
She's at work.

228
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,290
-She has already started going to work?
-Yeah, the day after you left.

229
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,080
Really?

230
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
She leaves in the morning
and comes back at night.

231
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,660
She works on her laptop
even after she comes back.

232
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,040
I would be willing to give
out more information…

233
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,830
but I would need something in return.

234
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,790
All you'll get is a kick up your bum.

235
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,500
You've become a professional blackmailer!

236
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,830
-You're all alone at home?
-No, Dhriti's here.

237
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,700
-How is she?
-Grumpy, as always.

238
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,080
Let me know about everything
that's happening at home.

239
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,290
Because nobody even
takes my calls anymore.

240
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,410
Don't worry, Sri. I am there, right?

241
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,330
I am your father! Got it?

242
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,790
And listen,
I am ordering that pizza for you.

243
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,910
By the way, Papa! New model is coming!

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,870
For what?

245
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,910
The iPhone. Don't you check the news?

246
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,910
Please book it in advance.

247
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,080
Your wish is my command!

248
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,370
Bye! Love you!

249
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,250
Between "I miss you" and "I love you,"
he's made me a jackass.

250
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
He's a crook!

251
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,120
He's your son, after all.

252
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,660
Did you talk to Suchi?

253
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,830
No… but she's started going to work.

254
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,910
Oh, nice.

255
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,540
Good for her. She'll be happy.

256
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, so when have I stopped her?

257
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,040
She used to work before, too.

258
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,660
You think I've ever stopped her?
What sort of a man does that!

259
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,200
-Hey--
-You think I am that kind of a man?

260
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,040
All I am saying is, both of you
sort out your issues, quickly.

261
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,660
Okay, let it go. Forget about it.

262
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,080
What the hell is wrong with you?

263
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
Your wife isn't talking to you.

264
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,500
Your daughter won't take your calls.
Your son is blackmailing you!

265
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,620
And you've spent the whole night in jail!

266
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,950
Trying to summarize your
life has depressed me.

267
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,040
Now, people will talk about
my family life in Tamil Nadu, too.

268
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,910
-How?
-You dumbfuck, he understands Hindi!

269
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,910
Muthu is our man.

270
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,250
Do you want to have coffee?

271
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,290
Yeah.

272
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,750
Arvind, I am…

273
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,790
I am really sorry.

274
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,620
I shouldn't have been harsh on
you, I am really sorry.

275
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,620
No, it's okay. It's okay.

276
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,870
It's just that I am…

277
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,700
I am not in a great state lately, and--

278
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,660
Suchi…

279
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,040
I know.

280
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,410
Everything is good.

281
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,870
I should have been more understanding
about how hard this must be for you.

282
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,500
But things will get better.

283
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,750
I promise.

284
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,580
And don't forget to send me those emails.

285
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,080
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

286
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,580
-Stay away from my phone.
-I am sorry, sir.

287
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,620
Have a seat.

288
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,580
Thank you.

289
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,790
I am really sorry about--

290
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,540
Apologize to him! God knows
what's happening with his phone!

291
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,790
-Is that working?
-At the moment, it's in a coma.

292
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,450
We'll know how it is,
once it regains consciousness.

293
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,580
-Sir.
-Yeah?

294
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,290
I have Nanda's postmortem report.

295
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,750
She killed him with her bare hands.

296
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,870
I think she's a trained fighter.

297
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,950
Okay, thank you.

298
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,120
Sir, I want to be a part
of this investigation.

299
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Tiwari, let her stay.

300
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,830
The decision has been made.

301
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,620
-Thank you--
-Sri!

302
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,580
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

303
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
I want you to see this.

304
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,410
The quality was very poor, sir…
but I used an algorithm.

305
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,660
It compresses the resolution
down so well that--

306
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,290
Damn good! You've done a fantastic job!

307
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,160
Now, show us the image, quickly!

308
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,120
Look.

309
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,450
Raji.

310
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,790
She's a part of the rebels' elite
unit, a commando.

311
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,450
Highly trained in jungle warfare,

312
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,950
hand-to-hand combat…

313
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,000
this unit is responsible
for all the daring missions.

314
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,950
Let's do one thing.
Circulate the photographs of Raji and…

315
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,910
all the rebels in this footage
with our security agencies.

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Find out which among
these are still alive.

317
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,000
Yes!

318
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,500
-I pledge my life for the movement.
-I pledge my life for the movement.

319
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,540
-I will protect our Tamil race.
-I will protect our Tamil race.

320
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,700
-I will give my life for the movement.
-I will--

321
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Come in, Local 52.

322
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,410
Come in, Local 52.

323
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,700
Come in, Local 52.

324
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,660
Local 52, over.

325
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,120
Three of us are coming on a pilgrimage.

326
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,290
We need to go get the items
for the rituals. Be ready.

327
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,410
We will leave for
Veeraranyam tomorrow morning.

328
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,620
I had a word with Local 52, Jebaraj.
He will make the necessary arrangements.

329
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,660
From here,

330
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,160
we will directly go to Veeraranyam.
First, we will go to this point, then…

331
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,790
Raji!

332
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,120
Sajid, tomorrow morning, the three
of us will leave for Veeraranyam.

333
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
From there, we will cross Sri Lanka,
and pick up supplies for the mission.

334
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,330
Raji, I have informed Jebaraj.

335
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,870
He will be waiting for us.

336
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,580
No more screwups!

337
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,870
Prabhu, you and Karthik stay
back and get the plane ready.

338
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,700
From now on,
you all will use these phones.

339
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,910
Only these phones from now on.

340
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,040
Drop your old phones in here.

341
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,620
Hello, Mr. Sambit.

342
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,080
-Are you playing games with us?
-Sorry?

343
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,200
Deepan, I want to know
if you and your comrades

344
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,000
are playing games with my country.

345
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,910
I have no idea what you are talking about!

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,870
Deepan, we've been picking up the chatter.

347
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,120
Your preferred channels that have been
lying silent for the past ten years…

348
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,580
have suddenly become a hive of activity.

349
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,790
I don't think this is a coincidence.

350
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,330
See, Bhaskaran has quit our government…
and I am the leader now.

351
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,080
We have nothing to do with what's
going on in Tamil Nadu right now.

352
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,120
Deepan, you need to stop Bhaskaran, now!

353
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,410
Or you will have to pay
the price for his actions.

354
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,750
Mr. Sambit, you know about me.

355
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,830
I believe in dialogue, not violence.

356
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,830
Please, give me some time.
I'll get back to you.

357
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,500
-Sri, JK! Where have you guys been?
-What happened?

358
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,410
The Q branch has intercepted communication

359
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,830
on the radio frequencies
used by the rebels.

360
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,870
The message was cryptic,
and rebel code words were used.

361
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,870
And the language was Sri Lankan Tamil.

362
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Two important words.
One, "Veeraranyam," a code word.

363
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,750
Number two, "Local 52."

364
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,000
Local 52? What's that?

365
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,660
Veeraranyam used to be
the main hub for the rebels.

366
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,750
And maybe, Local 52…

367
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,290
could be a code word
for one of the rebels.

368
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,540
We'll have to find out who.

369
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,790
We should go there.

370
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,250
Sure, but…

371
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,620
we have to be a little careful.

372
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,200
You see, there are a lot
of sympathizers for them.

373
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,580
Before leaving, we should ask
Sri Lankan intelligence agencies…

374
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,370
for information on Raji.

375
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay? Because I know,
these people never work alone.

376
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,000
And we should be knowing whom
they are working with here.

377
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,660
Sir, Mr. Deepan is here.

378
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,750
Ask him to come in.

379
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,370
Please come in, Mr. Deepan.

380
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,450
-Come, Deepan.
-Chief, the fish smells divine!

381
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,330
It's your and Subbu's favorite recipe.

382
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,120
Make yourself comfortable.

383
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,120
I still remember this
like it was yesterday.

384
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,370
Even now, sometimes, I make
two cups of coffee by mistake.

385
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,160
Come, let's eat.

386
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,660
Okay.

387
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,040
I have some good news, Chief.

388
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,830
The French Foreign Affairs Minister
has assured us that their government…

389
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,040
is inclined to recognize
our Government in Exile.

390
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,620
Good, good. Glad to see you're busy.

391
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,830
How have you been?

392
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,540
I just lost my brother.
The last member of my family.

393
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,620
How do you think I've been?

394
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,500
Bhaskaran, I don't have to remind you
of the struggle we've had to go through…

395
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,080
to gain some legitimacy for our movement.

396
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,410
Right now, we have to ensure that
we don't make any wrong moves.

397
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,830
Subbu was my brother, as well.

398
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,450
Yes, he was your brother.

399
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,000
And that is why, I trust, you will do
everything you can to bring him justice.

400
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,580
I have retired, Deepan.

401
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,000
The world no longer needs leaders
like me. It needs leaders like you.

402
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,950
Eat!

403
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,290
Mr. Sambit, you are right.

404
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,620
Bhaskaran is up to something.

405
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,120
You guys must watch him carefully.

406
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,330
For everyone's safety,
we will travel separately.

407
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,120
You and Raji take the coastal road.
I'll take the highway.

408
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,040
So, we have classified
it as a platform bug.

409
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,160
We have raised an issue
with the python developer.

410
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,660
Do we have a workaround?

411
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,250
No, but this is not
going to impact the client.

412
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,580
And I am sure by the time we are
ready with the alpha release, we should--

413
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,830
Sorry! Sorry to interrupt, guys…
but I have some really good news!

414
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,200
The client loved the pitch!

415
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,250
Fantastic.

416
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,580
So, congratulations.
Now, they want to see the demo ASAP.

417
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,120
Can we have it ready by next week?

418
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,660
Next week?

419
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,250
I think we'll manage.

420
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,700
Super. So, Arvind and Suchi…

421
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,120
you both might have to go to London
next week to make a presentation.

422
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,040
Be prepared!

423
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,660
And guys, tomorrow is family day.
Don't forget.

424
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,620
-Let's all have fun, okay?
-Yeah.

425
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,830
Carry on, Gunjan. Sorry.

426
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,040
So, let's have a look at the next
bug report in the next slide.

427
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,750
As you can see…

428
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,750
-How much for this?
-18,000.

429
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
And how much for this?

430
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,620
28,000.

431
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,080
-How much?
-Twenty-eight thousand only.

432
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,450
-Do you want me to sell my kidney?
-What?

433
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,540
-Something less?
-Show him something cheaper.

434
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,540
Three thousand only.

435
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,370
Okay. Give, give!

436
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,790
Wait, I will pay.

437
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,290
What? No, no! It's okay, Umayal.

438
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,330
No, it was my mistake. I will pay.

439
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,200
It is okay, just forget about the mobile.

440
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,950
But you can buy me a good
filter coffee, please!

441
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,950
-You like coffee?
-I love coffee.

442
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,660
Do you?

443
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,700
No coffee. No tea.

444
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,450
-Copy that!
-You said my name correctly!

445
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,040
-Umayal, right?
-Umayal, yes.

446
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,290
In Marathi also…

447
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,250
You seem to know this route very well.

448
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,580
Have you ever been to Kashmir?

449
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,290
No.

450
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,450
It's very beautiful.

451
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,040
I've heard even Sri Lanka
is extremely beautiful.

452
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,330
Why is so much stuff hidden so far away?

453
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,410
Chennai.

454
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,870
Veeraranyam.

455
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,500
Point Calimere.

456
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,620
Sri Lanka.

457
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,040
Point Pedro, Sri Lanka's northern tip.

458
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,040
One hour by boat.

459
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,910
Veeraranyam was our base.

460
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,080
We used to get all our
supplies from there.

461
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,080
We still have our people there.

462
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,160
-Whom do we have to meet there?
-Jebaraj. He's a smuggler.

463
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,370
He knows the coast guard's
routines and timings.

464
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,450
He's helping us.

465
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,950
We have two hours to reach Veeraranyam.

466
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,660
Talk to the local DSP.

467
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,040
Let's also talk to the local
rebel sympathizers.

468
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,290
Okay.

469
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,040
-Milind!
-Sir!

470
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,830
Keep a plainclothes team on standby.

471
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,250
We need to search all the safe houses.

472
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,700
Talpade!

473
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,870
Send an email to TASC Mumbai
and tell them about our plan.

474
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,250
Email?

475
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,000
Can I do it from your phone?

476
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,580
I don't give my phone to anybody.

477
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,910
Dude, my phone…

478
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,370
I'll have to type each alphabet.

479
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,450
Goddammit, I am working with the buffoons.

480
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,120
Kumar, give me one more drink.

481
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,250
Only after he pays up!

482
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,620
Murugun, I've known you since you were
a child, running around the beach naked.

483
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,080
Relax, I'll repay you.

484
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,660
When Jebaraj gives his word--

485
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,160
Your word means shit!

486
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,370
It has been two months since you paid!

487
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,370
Nobody in this town will entertain you!

488
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,830
Hey, do you realize who
the fuck you are talking to?

489
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,330
-And what are you saying?
-What now?

490
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,040
-How dare you raise your hand on me!
-I am warning you!

491
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,000
Jebaraj!

492
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,370
Jebaraj… are you sure you
will be able to do the job?

493
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,370
Looking at you, I have my doubts.

494
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,660
Chief, you forgot all that I did for you?

495
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,250
Nobody knows the routes as I do.

496
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,620
Don't worry. Everything is set.

497
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,290
We leave tonight and finish the job.

498
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,500
But my money…

499
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,580
You will get your money once
the job is done at Point Pedro.

500
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,450
We'll leave at 9:30 tonight.

501
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,620
Give me a list of the items you need.

502
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,790
Why do you want a list?

503
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,330
Anything that's not on the list is mine.

504
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,700
Also… I need an advance.

505
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,200
For my medicine.

506
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,500
Jebaraj…

507
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,950
don't drink on the job!

508
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,620
Understood?

509
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,620
I had an old list with me.

510
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,120
We've rounded up some
rebel sympathizers from it.

511
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,540
Here they are.

512
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,120
Have you heard from
anyone in the movement?

513
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,160
Oh, no, no.
You guys have no other work, sir?

514
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,080
The whole town of Veeraranyam
used to help the rebels.

515
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,370
They were regulars here…

516
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,580
but it's been many years
since we've seen them around.

517
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,290
Sir, it has been over
11 years since it all ended.

518
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,700
But one thing is sure…

519
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,120
martyrs never die!

520
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,290
Who is Local 52?

521
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,910
Even if someone sneezes, they round us up.

522
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,660
-I hope you know this is harassment!
-Hey!

523
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,700
Please don't hit me, sir!
I really don't know anything!

524
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,620
Who is Local 52?

525
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,330
I don't even remember my name.
What is this 52, 42?

526
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,500
I don't know who is doing
what, but they have my support.

527
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,410
-Pizza.
-Sure.

528
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,540
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

529
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,580
Sir, your pizza.

530
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,120
Keep it on the table.

531
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,750
Vissa!

532
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,160
Thank you, Visagan.

533
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,870
Take the night off.

534
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,870
Thank you, Chief. Good night.

535
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,370
Indians are watching you.

536
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,750
I have sent you everything
to go underground.

537
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,040
You must leave immediately.

538
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,200
Thank you, Sameer. See you soon.

539
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,450
I'll be in touch.

540
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,290
What trouble are you two cooking up now?

541
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,870
What trouble could I be cooking up!
I am just doing my homework.

542
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,410
What trouble could I be cooking up!
I was doing my homework.

543
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,750
Right, very funny.

544
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,580
Tomorrow, it's "bring your
kids to work" day at my office.

545
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,410
So, we're all going, okay?

546
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,830
I am not in the mood to socialize, Mom.

547
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,870
I am not in the mood to socialize, Mom.

548
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,160
But it'll be fun.

549
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,870
-I don't want to go.
-I don't want to go.

550
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,160
But it's such a small thing,
so what's with all the drama?

551
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,540
Did you go to Dad's office?

552
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,950
No.

553
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,450
Then, why are you forcing me to go?

554
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,910
Fine.

555
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,290
Suchi! Don't worry.

556
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,370
I will come to your office. Okay?

557
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,950
Now, go to bed.

558
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,200
Oh, well!

559
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,870
Sis, why are you always
so angry with Suchi?

560
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,620
Shut up, Atharv!

561
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,160
You don't know shit.

562
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,950
Go to your bed!

563
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,830
Brother.

564
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,540
Between 1:45 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.,
there won't be any coast guard trouble.

565
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,830
So, we can leave for Point Pedro
without setting off any alarms.

566
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,790
And similarly,

567
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,540
we need to be back in Veeraranyam
between 3:45 a.m. and 4:30 a.m.

568
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,450
The three of you, go to Point Pedro,
finish the job, and get back here.

569
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,500
I will wait here and keep watch.

570
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,000
You don't even drink coffee and tea.

571
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,330
Should I call for a lemonade?

572
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,040
Whiskey.

573
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,950
Whiskey!

574
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,790
Sir.

575
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,660
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

576
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,250
-Need anything, sir?
-No, thank you.

577
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,040
I'll join you.

578
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,910
This much? Small?

579
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,700
Okay.

580
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,620
Yes.

581
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,580
That's it?

582
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,580
Thanks.

583
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,450
Do you smoke?

584
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,080
-Yes.
-Oh, nice.

585
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,790
Thank you, JK.

586
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,290
JK told me everything…

587
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,750
about what happened in Delhi last year.

588
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,290
I didn't know.

589
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,200
How's your…

590
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,830
-friend?
-Zoya.

591
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,080
She's okay, physically, but…

592
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,370
she saved thousands of
lives, including mine.

593
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,790
I am lucky that I am alive today.

594
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,160
She'd only recently joined TASC.

595
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,580
To Zoya!

596
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,290
To Zoya!

597
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,950
This is my hometown

598
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,410
This is my land

599
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Only the sky belongs to all

600
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,830
This is my hometown

601
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,950
This is my land

602
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,540
Only the sky belongs to all

603
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,370
Are you thinking about your homeland?

604
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,370
Rupatunga wants to wipe
out all Sri Lankan Tamils.

605
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,450
Even when she was not
the PM, ten years ago…

606
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,500
Basu was Rupatunga's staunch ally…

607
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,580
and she gave him her
unconditional support.

608
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,370
There was a girl in my unit… Kayal.

609
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,790
She never wanted to leave Eelam.

610
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,040
Along with the others…

611
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,330
she surrendered to the Sri Lankan Army.

612
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,870
But Rupatunga killed her…

613
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,000
and thousands just like her.

614
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,750
Some people were lucky.

615
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,910
They managed to escape.

616
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,330
And the whole world just sat and watched.

617
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,870
I will kill all of them.

618
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,750
I will kill all of them!

619
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:19,870
Ones who satisfied my hunger

620
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,870
Along with my family

621
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,160
Where to go

622
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,450
Where to go, to live together

623
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,950
Is there any way here?

624
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,750
Hurry up, Jebaraj!

625
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,660
Daybreak is just two hours away.

626
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,410
Fucker, don't order me around!
I don't work for you.

627
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,330
No one is bigger than
the movement, Jebaraj.

628
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,000
Let's finish this and get out of here.
You will never see us again. Move it!

629
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,080
I don't give a shit about
your so-called movement.

630
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,870
I just want everything
that isn't on the list.

631
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,160
That's all!

632
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,080
This is the spot.

633
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,910
You can make yourself useful and dig!

634
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,160
I brought you here, didn't I?

635
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,370
Just because you look serious all the
time, doesn't mean you are some big shit.

636
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,910
Got it?

637
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,330
It's nothing.

Shit!

Who's there?

645
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,700
I am calling the base.

646
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,660
Alpha two! Alpha two!

Hey!

What the fuck have you done!

656
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,580
You killed Sri Lankan soldiers!

657
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,750
Fuck this shit! It's none of my business!
I am out of here!
