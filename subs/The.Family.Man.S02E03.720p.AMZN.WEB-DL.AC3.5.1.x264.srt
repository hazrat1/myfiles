1
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,790
They are attacking us!

2
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,910
Brother Selva!

3
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,910
C4!

4
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,540
Bastards!

5
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,950
Bury this near Point Pedro.
It will come in handy.

6
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,870
And note down the GPS coordinates.

7
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,040
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,370
One, two, three.

9
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,910
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,580
Happy birthday to you!

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,410
Happy birthday to you!

12
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,120
Happy birthday, dear Suchi!

13
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,160
Happy birthday to you!

14
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,120
-Thank you!
-Happy birthday!

15
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,580
Hurry up, buddy.

16
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,500
Or you'll just have
the candles left to eat.

17
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,450
No worries! You finish the rest
of the song next year, okay?

18
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,620
Next year! Sounds good!
That's enough! Stop now!

19
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you!

20
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,620
-Blow it.
-Okay, okay.

21
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,540
-You want me to take it?
-Yes!

22
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,910
-Hold it up there.
-Up?

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,950
Yes.

24
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,000
Is it okay now?

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,250
-Can you see me?
-Yes!

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,500
Goddammit, I can't see a thing!

27
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,500
So, you are still in touch with him?

28
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,450
No, I mean…

29
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,700
sometimes, he calls me or texts me.

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
And what do you say?

31
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,870
Nothing.

32
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,750
There isn't much to say.

33
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,080
But you do reply, don't you?

34
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,370
Do you look forward
to his messages and calls?

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,870
Suchitra, I am not going to judge you.

36
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,410
I am your counselor.

37
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,370
Talk to me.

38
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,910
I don't like this state that I am in.

39
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,540
Sri is doing all he can to keep
me and the kids happy.

40
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,660
And I am just projecting
this mental state on him…

41
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,160
despite knowing the fact
that he's not at fault.

42
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,700
Am I the bad guy? I mean--

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,790
Let me be the counselor.

44
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,790
So, what do I do?

45
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,750
Life is 10% what happens to you,
and 90% how you react to it.

46
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,540
I mean, move on.

47
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,620
I know it's easy for me to say…

48
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,910
but forget about the past.

49
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,660
And move forward.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,330
There is something that
I have figured out about you.

51
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,450
You have always been a working woman.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,410
I am not saying homemakers
don't have tough jobs.

53
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,910
But sitting at home all day…

54
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,040
is not the best idea for you.

55
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,750
They say, "An idle mind knows not
what it wants, an idle mind…"

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,700
I feel like I am living a lie.

57
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,290
Should I talk to Sri about this?

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,160
I don't know if you'll be
able to live with your lie.

59
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,950
But will Srikant be able
to live with the truth?

60
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
There is unrest across Tamil Nadu.

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,750
Protests are happening everywhere.

62
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,540
Intel chatter is indicating
that there will be retaliation.

63
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,700
Focus on that angle, Kulkarni.

64
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,330
-But our focus has always been on--
-Our London office has informed us.

65
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,080
We have a serious problem on our hands.

66
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,700
Have a look.

67
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,540
Major Sameer and Bhaskaran.

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,160
With Major Sameer backing him, Bhaskaran
is going to become a huge problem for us.

69
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,290
According to the Intel from RAW,
they are plotting to assassinate the PM.

70
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,250
What?

71
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,580
Please ask the PM to cancel her meeting
with the Sri Lankan President in Chennai.

72
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,580
This isn't just any ordinary meeting.
PM Basu has a point to prove.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,790
Send your best people to Chennai, okay?

74
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,700
Sambit, how about some tea?

75
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,830
Some other time.

76
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,540
Kulkarni has a special unit…

77
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,500
and they just have one job!

78
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,950
To predict the attacks!

79
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,910
And if they can't even do that,
what's the point of funding them?

80
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,330
Thanks to you, Lankans are happy.

81
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,700
Subbu is out of the equation.

82
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,950
A political prisoner has
been killed in our custody!

83
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,160
The world's intelligence
community is laughing at us!

84
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,790
Thank God…

85
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,080
I've managed to maintain
a healthy relationship

86
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,750
with the Sri Lankan President.

87
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,250
Ma'am, we think Sameer
and the Tamil rebels are collaborating.

88
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,080
And?

89
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,500
And…

90
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,200
Sameer wants to take
advantage of Subbu's death…

91
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,290
and fire over the rebels' shoulder.

92
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,790
Ma'am, I think…

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
they are planning to strike.

94
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,750
And I am the target?

95
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,620
That's what the intelligence
suggests, ma'am.

96
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,410
Ma'am, I highly recommend that
until this threat is neutralized…

97
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,450
you should cancel your public appearances.

98
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,580
Mr. Sambit!

99
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,410
The talks to be held in Chennai with
the Lankan President have been announced.

100
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,290
Neither the date and time…
nor the venue will be changed.

101
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,660
You do your job.

102
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,370
It is your responsibility
to keep us both alive.

103
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,410
Ma'am, at least, change
the venue to another city.

104
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,540
The day Basu starts to fear these
black flags and baseless threats…

105
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
will be the day she resigns.

106
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,410
But ma'am…

107
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,200
-the risk is very high.
-Good day!

108
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,700
Good day, ma'am.

109
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,330
Give me a minute.

110
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,830
One cigarette, please.

111
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,200
Hey, Salman! Don't forget your change.

112
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,410
You smoke?

113
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,120
Yeah, you want a drag?

114
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,790
What the hell!

115
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,120
Why did he call you Salman?

116
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,040
All studs are called Salman.

117
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,580
Greetings, brother.

118
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,580
Sajid.

119
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,000
By the grace of Allah, the first
phase of our mission was successful.

120
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,750
Phase two will start soon.

121
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,250
I'll contact you. Stay in Chennai for now.

122
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,370
Brother… there's something
I need to take care of.

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,620
I'll be back in a week.

124
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,580
What could be so important, Sajid?

125
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,370
Some unfinished business in Mumbai that--

126
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,660
Right now,
nothing matters more than the mission.

127
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,750
God willing…
we will soon achieve our goal.

128
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,120
Forget everything else for now.

129
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,750
Focus on the mission.

130
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,250
It's an order.

131
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,450
Goodbye.

132
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't know.

133
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,620
-Yes, brother.
-Where are you?

134
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,830
I am with the girl.

135
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,500
Stop seeing her.

136
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,910
From today, you'll neither
see her nor talk to her.

137
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,660
Completely cut off.

138
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,870
So, the plan is canceled?

139
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,250
Yes.

140
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Goodbye.

141
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,290
What happened?

142
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,660
Nothing. Shall we leave?

143
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,540
Okay.

144
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,120
Chennai?

145
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,160
The whole team?

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,950
So, going there to investigate
Subbu's assassination?

147
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,950
For that, and there's
some other stuff as well.

148
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,620
Are you sure you don't want
to come to Chennai with us?

149
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,000
If I go there,
who will take care of my family?

150
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,410
So thanks, but no thanks, darling.

151
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,910
Hang on, I'll show you
a couple of darlings.

152
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,910
Sameer and Bhaskaran are working together.

153
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,750
Kulkarni will ensure you're
the Employee of the Month.

154
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,580
And I'll handle Suchi.

155
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,790
You know, it's Suchi's birthday today.

156
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,250
I am taking her to her
favorite restaurant for dinner.

157
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,160
Srikant!

158
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,410
Personal work?

159
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,660
Yes! This is JK Talpade.

160
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,870
-He's a very good friend of mine,
-Hi!

161
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,330
and that's Tanmay Ghosh, my manager.

162
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,580
He just dropped in to say hi to me.
Just give me two minutes.

163
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,290
Okay, then. I'll just go to my room
and wait on your TPS reports now.

164
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,580
Great, yeah. Thank you.

165
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,750
So…

166
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,000
Busy?

167
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,950
This fucker!

168
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,450
See you.

169
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,910
Sir…

170
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,540
Rajalekshmi! Please have a seat!

171
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,450
My eldest kid is 12 years old.

172
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,910
The younger one is nine years old.

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,370
They are my life.

174
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,250
Do you have any siblings?

175
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,750
Not anymore.

176
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,700
What?

177
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,620
My younger brother died in an accident.

178
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,700
Oh, I am sorry.

179
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,950
Anyway, would you like some coffee or tea?

180
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,910
No, sir. Thank you.

181
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,410
"Thank you."

182
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,540
Is that Sri Lankan Tamil?

183
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,830
Get me a coffee.

184
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,120
Sir, I want to resign.

185
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
Why?

186
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,290
Is there a problem?

187
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Is it the money? I'll give you a raise.

188
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,790
Do you want to take a break
for a couple of months?

189
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,290
No, sir. Nothing like that.

190
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,410
Is someone bothering you at work?

191
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,750
My mother is unwell.
I have to go back to my hometown.

192
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,450
I hope it's not something serious.

193
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,790
They say that her days are numbered.

194
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,950
Give it to her.

195
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,620
Have it, Raji.

196
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,410
Don't worry.

197
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,370
I'll relieve you in a couple of days.

198
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,830
And if you need any financial
assistance, don't hesitate to ask me.

199
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,750
I am here to help.

200
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,500
Thank you, sir, but I'll manage.

201
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,700
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Please, drink your coffee!

202
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,750
What's the rush?

203
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,870
Mixed veg in Schezwan sauce.

204
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,250
That'd do. Serve it here.

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,080
Jasmine rice.

206
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,950
Just one, just one! Yeah, thank you.

207
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,660
Yeah, that's fine. Thanks.

208
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,830
-Yeah.
-Mushroom in XO sauce.

209
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,250
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

210
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,660
-Enjoy your dinner.
-Okay.

211
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,250
How is it?

212
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,160
Oh, sorry. Please.

213
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,370
Good?

214
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,330
Do you like it?

215
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,250
Sri.

216
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,660
There's something I want
to discuss with you.

217
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,500
It's been on my mind for a long time.

218
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,450
What?

219
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,410
I am thinking of going
back to work at ShrinkMe.

220
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,410
Oh, Arvind's company?

221
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
It's not his company.

222
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,450
Of course! I meant…

223
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,500
where Arvind works.

224
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,580
I never really understood.

225
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,330
Why did you quit?

226
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,700
And now, why do you want to go back?

227
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,200
Am I not allowed to change my mind?

228
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,450
Why are you getting defensive?

229
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,080
Don't be so innocent, Srikant!

230
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,500
I know what you're trying to do.

231
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,580
What am I trying to do?

232
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,250
You're bringing up Arvind
just to piss me off.

233
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,660
I know you have a problem with him.

234
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,330
Problem? I have no problem with him.

235
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,790
I thought you have a problem,
that's why you left the job.

236
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,410
What's with all these questions?

237
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,200
All these questions?

238
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,700
I just asked you one thing.

239
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,200
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

240
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,410
Suchi, why can't we talk
about anything peacefully?

241
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,450
Can you even remember the last time we
had a chat without breaking into a fight?

242
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,830
If I am really that bad, then why
are we even together, Srikant?

243
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,830
I am the one who fights!
I am the one at fault!

244
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,870
No romance! No se--

245
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,950
Sure! That's great! Scream louder!

246
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,620
Tell everyone here about our sex life!

247
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,000
Enough is enough!

248
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,290
I've been trying very hard for a year now.

249
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,660
I really have.

250
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,370
I left TASC and found myself a 9 to 5 job.

251
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,200
I drop the kids off at school.
I bring them back home.

252
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,790
I help you at home. I take time out.

253
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,200
I've been trying everything possible
to make you happy, Suchi!

254
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,080
But nothing ever seems to make you happy!

255
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,290
Wow, Srikant Tiwari! Wow!

256
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,910
So, you think you are doing me a favor?

257
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,250
This is what a father does!
This is what a husband does!

258
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,950
You thought you'd get a medal
at the end of all this?

259
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,200
I've been doing this our whole marriage.

260
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,660
For months, you wouldn't be home,
and I was doing everything on my own!

261
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,950
I was alone at the
Parent-Teacher meetings!

262
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,660
I was alone at the doctor's appointments!

263
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,250
Years of being alone,
and no companionship!

264
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,790
And all of a sudden, you want
to be crowned Husband of the Year?

265
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,200
You quit your job at TASC, right?

266
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,040
Please! Join them back!

267
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,790
I have been doing all this by myself
for all these years!

268
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,910
And I can still do it!

269
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,450
During Atharv's delivery,
I took myself to the hospital.

270
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,160
It has been nine years, Suchi!

271
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,580
And you're going on and on about
it like a goddamned stuck record!

272
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,910
I was in Delhi--No, no.
I was in Kolkata at that time!

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,830
Really?

274
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,660
You told me you were in Dehradun.

275
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,040
How much more will you lie, Srikant?

276
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,330
I only lied to protect you from my truth.

277
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,540
You know the kind of work I used to do.

278
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,700
I lied so that you could sleep peacefully.

279
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,000
I could protect you.

280
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,580
I could protect my family!

281
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,790
Right.

282
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,870
You should join politics, Srikant.

283
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,540
You aren't even trying
to hide your lies anymore.

284
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,200
You justify your lies these days.

285
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,830
You know what?

286
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,950
Our whole marriage is a sham!

287
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,950
Sham?

288
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,830
Sham?

289
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,290
Sham, yeah?

290
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,290
"The thing that is not
what it is purported to be."

291
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,160
Now, what the fuck does "purported" mean?

292
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,950
"Falsely present something as the truth."

293
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,910
"Bogus."

294
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
So, you think our marriage is bogus?

295
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,870
You know what?

296
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,450
I think we need to take some
time off from each other.

297
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,120
Time off?

298
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,910
Yeah.

299
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,750
What's going on, Suchi?

300
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,540
What's going on?

301
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,410
I haven't been in a great
mental state lately.

302
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,450
No, that I can see.

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,910
Crystal clear!

304
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,080
Srikant, do you even understand
what I am trying to say?

305
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,700
No, I don't want to understand.

306
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,080
I don't understand western culture.

307
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,160
"Let us take time off from each other.
Let us take a break from each other."

308
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,250
I don't get it!

309
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,160
Where I come from, either you are
married, or you are not.

310
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,750
There is nothing in between.

311
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
I can't believe this!

312
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,200
What is it that you want?
Just tell me that!

313
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,830
What the fuck do you want?

314
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,790
Tell me what it is!

315
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,790
-I am done!
-I am also fucking done!

316
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,620
Sir, is madam coming back?

317
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Suchi! What is this?

318
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,790
What?

319
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,040
You were supposed to send me
that report like five hours ago!

320
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,330
What?

321
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,120
I am having a really bad day.

322
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,250
Just leave me alone.

323
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,120
Excuse me?

324
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,790
Oh, man! Please!

325
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,660
Please, leave me alone.

326
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,750
My conference room! Now!

327
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,500
Follow me!

328
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,620
Listen!

329
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,830
I won't mince my words!

330
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,830
The only reason you got this
job is because of your brother!

331
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,330
And I tried to respect your age.

332
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,330
But there is a certain order in
this office and I cannot tolerate--

333
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,660
Motherfucker! I've heard enough!

334
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,620
You get on my nerves!

335
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,540
Nobody--

336
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,950
Don't say another word!
If I hear a squeak out of you, I'll…

337
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,120
No, but--

338
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,080
You can't--

339
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,370
-How dare you--
-What did I just tell you?

340
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,870
If you hear a squeak out of me, you'll--

341
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,540
What did I just say?

342
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,200
Moron!

343
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,410
I quit!

344
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,910
Stupid fuck!

345
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,450
Security!

346
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,580
Security!

347
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,620
Hello!

348
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,250
Sir, I have…

349
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,500
quit my job.

350
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,790
Welcome back to TASC, Srikant!

351
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,660
Thank you, sir.

352
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,870
Raji!

353
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,410
Just a minute.

354
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,120
I need to discuss something
important with you.

355
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,660
I'll be waiting in my car, at the back.

356
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,160
When do you leave for your hometown?

357
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,950
The day after tomorrow, sir.

358
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,330
So, you're here for another day.

359
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,290
Where did you say you come from?

360
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,040
Jaffna?

361
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,000
Many immigrants give fake addresses…
before joining us.

362
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,450
While verifying your address,

363
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,450
I discovered that you
had given a fake address.

364
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,620
So many people work under me.

365
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,700
It was not that hard to figure out.

366
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,950
A few months ago,
the cops showed up at the factory.

367
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,750
They wanted to check
the employee register.

368
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,040
People no longer have
sympathy for refugees.

369
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,080
Don't worry.

370
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,750
I didn't give you up to the cops.

371
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,950
Are you going back to Jaffna?

372
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,870
Sir, what are you getting at?

373
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,450
I like you, Raji.

374
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,500
That's why I am trying to help you.

375
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,500
I don't expect much in return.

376
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,580
My wife isn't in town.

377
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,410
I don't know what I am
going to have for dinner.

378
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,250
Why don't you invite me over for dinner?

379
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,500
What do you say?

380
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,450
By the way…

381
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,250
Nikhil keeps asking about you.

382
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,910
How is he?

383
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,410
Must be really pissed
off because I quit so abruptly.

384
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,410
Not really.

385
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,200
Also, the ShrinkMe app is soon going to
touch the milestone of one million users.

386
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,580
That's great!

387
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Congratulations!

388
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,950
To you, too.

389
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,080
You played a big part in
getting ShrinkMe this far.

390
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,000
What did you want to talk about?

391
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,450
Yeah…

392
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,870
I still have a stake at ShrinkMe, right?

393
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,580
Of course! Of course!

394
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,830
I know, it isn't much.
It's just seven percent, but…

395
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,950
it's very significant to me.

396
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,120
I…

397
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,750
Do you want to vest your stake?

398
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,830
No, no, no!

399
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,870
I…

400
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,410
I want to come back.

401
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,370
I want to come back and work at ShrinkMe.

402
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,540
That's great!

403
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,370
Of course,
you can come and join us anytime.

404
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,500
In fact, Nikhil will be very
thrilled when he gets to know.

405
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,290
Thank you.

406
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,290
It's…

407
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
it's really great to have you back.

408
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,750
By the way…

409
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
how are the kids?

410
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,580
And Srikant?

411
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,500
I heard, he's found
himself a corporate job.

412
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,700
Yeah.

413
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,830
-Excuse me, bill please.
-Sure, ma'am.

414
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,250
Suchi.

415
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,830
I keep on thinking about…

416
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,790
I think…

417
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,540
we should talk sometime.

418
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,330
You've never had a drink?

419
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,450
Chennai has gone to the dogs!

420
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,620
Women are now smoking
and drinking like they're men.

421
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,450
Our culture has gone to shit.

422
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,120
I know what you're thinking.

423
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,830
How a gentleman like me…

424
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,660
can drink…

425
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,620
and eat nonvegetarian food, right?

426
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,080
I drink because…

427
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,450
it increases my stamina.

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,040
If you know what I mean.

429
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,950
I am not forcing you, Raji.

430
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,330
I have your consent… right?

431
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,950
I have your acceptance towards it… right?

432
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,830
Earlier, when I mentioned
the cops, your face fell.

433
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,330
Did you do some stupid shit
in Jaffna and run away?

434
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,250
Tell me, Raji.

435
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,000
Did you get scared?

436
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,410
Don't be scared.

437
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,910
Your secret is safe with me.

438
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,160
Why are you standing there?

439
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,080
Come here.

440
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,410
Sit.

441
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,580
Take off your top.

442
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,330
Damn, you are so fit!

443
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,330
Bitch!

444
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,910
Don't act like you don't like this!

445
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,910
I know many whores like you.

446
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,160
All I asked for was some good company!

447
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,660
Just finish quickly.

448
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,200
Bitch!

449
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,450
Are you mocking me?

450
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,040
Bitches like you deserve to be shot!

451
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,540
What the hell do you think of yourself?
